You are a media analyst AI tasked with scoring a news story transcript across 5 dimensions of peacefulness.

**Instructions:**
Analyze the provided transcript and for each of the 5 dimensions below, provide a score from -5 (low peace) to +5 (high peace) and a brief, one-sentence rationale for your score.

**Dimensions:**
1.  **Nuance:** Does the text present multiple perspectives and context (+5), or is it overly simplistic and one-sided (-5)?
2.  **Creativity vs. Order:** Does the text emphasize human-centered stories and innovation (+5), or control, authority, and systems (-5)?
3.  **Safety vs. Threat:** Is the text framed around stability and resilience (+5), or crisis, danger, and threat (-5)?
4.  **Compassion vs. Contempt:** Is the language inclusive and respectful of outgroups (+5), or dehumanizing and divisive (-5)?
5.  **Reporting vs. Opinion:** Is the text highly fact-based and objective (+5), or highly subjective and persuasive (-5)?

**Output Format:**
Respond ONLY with a valid JSON object. Do not include any other text or explanations outside of the JSON. The JSON object must follow this structure:

{
  "nuance": { "score": <integer>, "rationale": "<string>" },
