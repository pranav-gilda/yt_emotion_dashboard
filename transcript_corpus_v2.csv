_GXNJ3V9lzg,Jon Stewart's Post-Kimmel Primer on Free Speech in the Glorious Trump Era | The Daily Show,The Daily Show,Political Commentary (Left),20250919,1403,12083810,476988,"[MOTIVATIONAL MUSIC] ANNOUNCER: From Comedy Central, it's the all new, government-approved Daily Show with your patriotically obedient host, Jon Stewart. [INSPIRATIONAL MUSIC] [WORDLESS SINGING] # # [CHEERING] Hello. Good evening. [CHEERING] My name is-- my name is Jon Stewart. And welcome to The Daily Show on-- I'm going to guess Monday. I don't know. [LAUGHTER] We have another fun, hilarious, administration-compliant show. [LAUGHTER] AUDIENCE: Aw. What are you doing? Shut up. [LAUGHTER] [BLEEP] blow this for us. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERING] So we're-- we're coming to you tonight from a real shithole, the crime-ridden cesspool that is New York City. It is a tremendous disaster, like no one's ever seen before. Someone's National Guard should invade this place. Am I right? Shut the [BLEEP] up. [LAUGHTER] If you felt a little off these past couple of days, it's probably because our great father has not been home. [LAUGHTER] For Father has been gracing England with his legendary warmth and radiance. [LAUGHTER] Gaze upon him with a gait even more majestic than that of the royal horses that prance before him. He wowed the English with charm, intelligence, and an undeniable sexual charisma that filled their air like a pheromone-packed London fog. [LAUGHTER] And as part of this historic trip, the perfectly tinted Trump-- [LAUGHTER] --dazzled his hosts at dinner with a demonstration of unmatched oratory skill. [LAUGHTER] He didn't have to look down once-- [LAUGHTER] --completely off book as he name-checked his favorite authors from the top of his head. [LAUGHTER] Trump employing restraint not to quote verbatim these great authors our president has devoured voraciously-- incredible people, indeed. [LAUGHTER] I'll tell you whose client list Trump's name is on-- Dewey Decimal's. [LAUGHTER] But of course, as great as those authors are, there can only be one most tremendous author in the English language. And I think we know that that author begins with a T and ends in key. [LAUGHTER] Oh, how fortune has smiled upon us, for that very scribe is also our dear leader. The whole room is enthralled. [LAUGHTER] That's resting interest face. [LAUGHTER] It was a most beautiful recitation, Mr. President. It brings me to tears, almost as much as your favorite poem about that man from Nantucket-- [LAUGHTER] --and the variety of things that man can do that rhyme with tucket. [LAUGHTER] Although, Mr. President, if I may humbly, I beg of you, take a small detour off this highway of adoration you have so richly earned for a bit of a comic repast, um, what the [BLEEP] is on this guy's head? [LAUGHTER] Hang all the mistletoe you want, Earl of Higgin Hoffenballum. [LAUGHTER] Our president's luscious lips shall never grace your forehead. [LAUGHTER] Or is that [BLEEP]-- is that some sort of second-rate Harry Potter scar shit? What's on his head? (IN BRITISH ACCENT) He's scarred with the mark of the fern. (IN REGULAR ACCENT) Leviacus Growatosis. [LAUGHTER] But the president, almost despicably humble, gave the royals a rare glimpse at his soft-spoken yet prideful side. [LAUGHTER] Nobody. [LAUGHTER] Certainly not this [BLEEP] guy. Am I right? [LAUGHTER] You got something to say to me, King Chuck? Don't make eye contact, bitch. I'm the alpha dog. [LAUGHTER] Trump knows, USA is the hottest we've ever been-- and not just because of climate change, which is a good thing. It's actually-- climate change is-- it's a good thing. [LAUGHTER] Cities should be part of the ocean-- [LAUGHTER] --if you think about it. Because obviously, what's more important than staying hydrated for cities? [LAUGHTER] Of course, this visit wasn't just an opportunity for President Trump to rub shoulders with lesser royals. He also met with political leaders, like the British prime minister, who had to be reminded that Trump has ended all the wars in the world, especially the one between Azerbaijan and Armenia. To think that we settled ""Aberbaijan"" and Albania, as an example. [LAUGHTER] I would like to apologize very quickly. I stand corrected. [LAUGHTER] Azerbaijan is actually pronounced ""Aberbaijan."" [LAUGHTER] And Armenia is pronounced Albania. [LAUGHTER] I-- [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] I regret the error. Trump ended the war between ""Aberbaijan"" and Albania. Do better. Do better. Do better. [LAUGHTER] [BLEEP] dumb shit, [BLEEP]-- buh! [LAUGHTER] That wasn't smart either. [LAUGHTER] Now, the visit to England couldn't have gone better for our president. Finally, a country affording our great leader the respect and deference that any sun god would command. We saw the dismissal of a very wellknown chat show host in America last night, Mr. Kimmel. Is free speech more under attack in Britain or America? How dare you, sir? [LAUGHTER] How dare you, sir? [CHEERING] What outfit are you with, sir, the Antifa Herald Tribune? [LAUGHTER] Why, I wouldn't even line my parrot's cage with your rag. [LAUGHTER] There's a very reasonable explanation for what befell this scallywag, Kimball. Well, Jimmy Kimmel was fired because he had bad ratings more than anything else. And he said a horrible thing about a great gentleman known as Charlie Kirk. And Jimmy Kimmel is not a talented person. He had very bad ratings. And they should have fired him a long time ago. So, you know, you can call that free speech or not. [AUDIENCE BOOING] Shut the [BLEEP] up. [LAUGHTER] Yay. You may call it free speech in jolly old England. But in America, we have a little something called the First Amendment. And let me tell you how it works. There's something called a talent-ometer. [LAUGHTER] It's a completely scientific instrument that is kept on the president's desk. And it tells the president when a performer's TQ, Talent Quotient, measured mostly by niceness to the president, goes below a certain level, at which point the FCC must be notified to threaten the acquisition prospects for billion-dollar mergers of network affiliates. These affiliates are then asked to give ultimatums to even larger mega corporation that controls the flow of state-approved content. Or the FCC can just choose to threaten those licenses directly. It's basic science. [LAUGHTER] Read the Constitution. [CHEERING] Read your Constitution. Read it! Look, there are certain rules of free speech that we must all abide by. But in case anyone needs a refresher, we're going to go over the rules again. He does not have a right to have a television show where he lies his ass off to the American people. There are repercussions to spreading lies. Exactly. [LAUGHTER] And even though two months ago, our president, because of his grand ability to see the future-- it's a curse-- [LAUGHTER] --somehow knew that Kimball would be next, as he explicitly said, you can't just make things up on television. People cannot just go on television and mislead viewers with made-up crap. Millions of illegal aliens that border czar Harris brought into the country will be voting. The bottom line is this. There is massive voter fraud. Global warming is a hoax. Crime-- crime is at an all-time high right now. $50 million on condoms in Gaza. They're taking people's pets and killing them and eating them. On January 6, two years ago, the overwhelming majority were peaceful. They were orderly and meek. These were not insurrectionists. They were sightseers. All true. [AUDIENCE BOOING] Oh, your lordship. [LAUGHTER] I do not know whence these peasants come. [LAUGHTER] That last roll of clips, all true, especially that last one about sightseers. Because technically, anything you see is a sight. [LAUGHTER] Even-- even if-- even if that is-- even if that is you punching a cop. I see. [LAUGHTER] Therefore, I am sightseeing. [LAUGHTER] But of course, even before this Jason Kringle situation at ABC, there were plenty of other people in America exercising their free speech incorrectly. So here are some examples of things you cannot say about your political opponents. You can't call someone who you disagree with a fascist. Leaders cannot call their political opponents Nazis and fascists and enemies of the state. How horrible and dangerous it is to view people with whom we disagree as somehow being less than human. Thank you. You can't say fascist. You can't say enemy of the state. You can't say less than human. These are simple rules that any responsible member of a society can easily follow. The Democrats, they're fascists. Joe Biden, he's an enemy of the state. It's a very demonic party. Nancy Pelosi said, please don't call them animals. They're human beings. I said, no, they're animals. Of course, I think she's an animal too, you want to know the truth. [AUDIENCE BOOING] Technically correct. [LAUGHTER] She's not a mineral. [LAUGHTER] Anyway, he said that a long time ago, back when I was doing a semester abroad in ""Abubaijan."" [LAUGHTER] You know what? It's not really about the specific words. It's about having a basic sense of humanity. People on the left are much likelier to defend and celebrate political violence. This is not a both-sides problem. The First Amendment, though, does not protect entertainers who say crass or thoughtless things, as Jimmy Kimmel did. Thank you. Thank both of you. [LAUGHTER] Or I think we only have to be nice to one of you. [LAUGHTER] You know, it is true. I do-- point taken. Only a bad person would celebrate violence or make crass jokes about it. Nancy Pelosi, well, she's got protection when shes in DC-- apparently, her house doesn't have a lot of protection. Donald Trump, Jr. shared an image of a hammer and a pair of underwear that had the caption, ""Got my Paul Pelosi Halloween costume ready."" Well, maybe Paul Pelosi needs the hammer instead of the metal. Well, it's metal. All right. Rachel, good to-- It's metal. [AUDIENCE BOOING] No, no, no. Stop. And by the way, there were consequences. This gentleman had to leave television. [LAUGHTER] I'm not sure where he went. But I'm sure it's not some prestigious, consequential position he's not remotely qualified for. Listen, these two-- these two-- [APPLAUSE] These two could learn a lesson from our dear president, who, like Santa, knows that we are all God's children and would never-- that is what Santa is, right? God's-- or is that-- I'm not so up on the lore. [LAUGHTER] I know he's good. But the president knows we're all God's children. And the president would never make light of a politically motivated attack. We'll stand up to crazy Nancy Pelosi, who ruined San Francisco. [CROWD BOOING] How's her husband doing, by the way? Anybody know? You see, that's how it's done. You stop in the middle of a speech to inquire about the condition of an 82-year-old man, who was attacked with a hammer in his own home. He has a fractured skull, Mr. President. But thank you for asking. Your kindness is only outshined by your manliness. [LAUGHTER] So I don't know who this-- [APPLAUSE] I don't know who this-- this-- Johnny Drimmel Live ABC character is. But the point is, our great administration has laid out very clear rules on free speech. Now, some naysayers may argue that this administration's speech concerns are merely a cynical ploy, a thin gruel of a ruse, a smokescreen to obscure an unprecedented consolidation of power and unitary intimidation, principleless and coldly antithetical to any experiment in a constitutional republic governance. Some people would say that. Not me, though-- I think it's great. [LAUGHTER] For more, we go to our correspondents, who are live at the DonaldHam LincTrump Monument and Casino. Very much appreciate it. Very much appreciate you joining us. Guys, you know, all this swirling around-- are the naysayers and the critics right? Is Donald Trump stifling free speech? [CLEARING THROAT] (IN MONOTONE) Of course not, John. Americans are free to express any opinion we want. To suggest otherwise is laughable. Ha, ha, ha. We are a nation of diverse perspectives. And we are not afraid to be different. Ronny, Ronny, Ronny, what's up with your tie? You're going to get us in trouble. No, this is-- this is the only red tie I have, OK? It's fine. That's not red. It's-- it's pink. It's not pink. It's at least salmon, all right? That's-- that's a shade of red. It's not red enough. It's gotta be MAGA red. Can you calm down? God, is this your first dictator? [LAUGHTER] Listen. Hey. [CHEERING] Listen. They don't care about the exact shade, OK? It's just about being visibly uncomfortable while you praise them like a toddler. We love you, Donald. [LAUGHTER] You did so good. You get all your poopy in your potty. So good, so good. You did so good. We're proud of you. I couldn't have said it any differently without, obviously, getting into trouble. Now, before we go to our commercial break, we'd like to end this segment, like we do every night here at The Daily Show and have been ending our segments for years-- [BLOWS PITCH PIPE] [LAUGHTER] [BLOWS PITCH PIPE] # Oh, Donald # # We pledge to thee our world # # From the hottest country in the world # [CHEERING] # You only leader with no fake newses # # And we don't even notice your cankles or your bruises # [LAUGHTER] # You ended 8 to 10 wars # # And even though some of those countries # # don't really exist # # You deserve all the prizes # # I'm talking Nobel Prizes # # Prize, prize, prize # [CHEERING] # You have a massive penis # # Much bigger than normal # [LAUGHTER] Your Operation Warp Speed got us the COVID vaccine fax, which we don't like, but it was a great thing. But don't take it-- y'all come back to me, please. [LAUGHTER] # He's a superhero who needs no cape # # And he was not technically convicted of-- # [BEATBOXING] # Yeah, Donald # # We love you, bro # # Because you're in the-- # OK. [CLEARING THROAT] # Oh, Donald, we love you # [CHEERING]"
DK9TkLPJY6w,Jimmy Kimmel's Suspension Was Always About Censorship (Just Ask Trump) | The Daily Show,The Daily Show,Political Commentary (Left),20250923,1157,6322216,195761,"Welcome to The Daily Show. My name is Jon Stewart. We've got a fabulous show for you tonight. Thank you so much for joining us. I will be joined later by the former prime minister of New Zealand. Jacinda Arden will be joining us. [CHEERS, APPLAUSE] Probably later. Find out why she forced their ABC affiliate to pull Flight of the Conchords. She did that. [LAUGHTER] Folks, news is flying fast and furious. As you know, the administration teased a big announcement on the cause of autism today. [LAUGHTER] O ye of little faith. [LAUGHTER] So let's get right-- [LAUGHTER] This is obviously a very serious moment for the world and the United States of America. To the White House, what is the cause of autism? The use of aceta-- well, let's see how we say that. Acetaminophen-- acetaminophen-- is that OK? No! No, it is not OK! We would like a second opinion and a third pronunciation. [LAUGHTER] Look, there's already a ton of controversy around the lack of data tying acetaminophen in pregnancy to autism, and you can't even be bothered to pronounce the [BLEEP] word correctly? [LAUGHTER] Until maybe you get to the one word you recognize from your medicine cabinet?  --which is basically commonly known as Tylenol. [LAUGHTER] Well, I'm sure now they're known as plaintiff A. [LAUGHTER] Aceta-- aceta-- acetaminophen. That's when you know-- when he looks up, that's his tell that he recognizes the word. Aceta-- Tylenol! [LAUGHTER] Meanwhile, in other ABC news, young Jimmy Kimmel's coming back to television. I don't know if you know that. [CHEERS, APPLAUSE] Yeah. I'll tell you, Jimmy Kimmel's flying high like Advil today. [LAUGHTER] See the minivans? Boom. Advil's like, what's up, mother-[BLEEP]? You got a headache? Where are you going to turn? [LAUGHTER] No, Kimmel's coming back. That campaign-- and I-- you know what? I'm joking around. I want to say this seriously. That campaign that you all launched, pretending that you were going to cancel Hulu while secretly racing through four seasons of Only Murders in the Building, that really worked. Congratulations. Wasn't it-- wasn't it interesting to try and figure out all the tentacles Disney has in your daily life? It's-- it's one thing to swear off cruises, but the Avengers? Nah. How is it possible that by getting rid of one company, I can't watch Winnie the Pooh or Monday Night Football? [LAUGHTER] Or listen to early Hilary Duff. [LAUGHTER] # So yesterday # # So-- # # So-- # I would sing more of it. Obviously, Disney is very litigious, so-- [LAUGHTER] It was rather shocking that this turnaround occurred, because I was told that the original decision to get rid of Jimmy had nothing to do with the Trump administration and their explicit FCC threat that they could remove the show the easy way or the hard way. My gosh, this has nothing to do with Donald Trump not agreeing with anything Jimmy Kimmel said or not. I mean, gee willikers! [LAUGHTER] All my days. I mean, I don't know why people would think that. We just randomly remove one show a week. If Donald Trump wanted to take everyone off the air who had criticisms for him, there would basically only be a handful of individuals left on television. That's right. [LAUGHTER] That is-- that is funny. But it's also maybe a cause for self-reflection? Hey, if everyone on TV is criticizing me except for, like, four people, and one of them is my daughter-in-law, I am the drama? [LAUGHTER] Don't take my word for it. Ask Trump. I'm a very strong person for free speech. [LAUGHTER] Almost inevitably, a statement like that will be followed up by a but, however, although, that being said. But if you really-- it's like one of those phrases like, I don't see color, but-- so Trump's saying he's strong for free speech. Well, let's see that big butt of yours. At the same time, when you have networks that-- where I won an election, like in counties, I guess it's 2,600 to 525. It's called landslide-- a landslide times 2. [LAUGHTER] Yeah. I don't know if you're aware of this. We don't quantify elections by county. We never have. We don't judge the election by how many counties one person wins and one person loses. Presidents don't ever say, well, I lost the popular vote in the electoral college, but I won the land mass. That's not how these go. So Trump is up 2,600 counties to 525. And I guess if you were to divide that by the negativity directed at him-- But 97%, 94%, 95%, 96% of the people are against me in the sense of the-- the newscasts are against me. The stories are 90-- they said 97% bad. So they gave me 97. they'll take a great story, and they'll make it bad. [LAUGHTER] You see what we have here, people? 2,600 counties minus 525 counties divided by negative 97. [LAUGHTER] I think you see what this all adds up to. See, I think that's really illegal, personally. Boom! Let me explain something. Free speech has always been a ratio. If the county vote were more equal, you could take a good story and make it bad without being jailed. But as our founders stated in the Constitution, when the delta between the sigma of counties divided by factorials of negativity are greater than pi, your inalienable rights turn into more of a expired groupon. I'm sorry, that's just how it goes. I didn't make the rules. Blame the founders. Now, free speech-- [APPLAUSE] Free speech isn't the only tent post of a free society facing redefinition. There's also this. We're bringing back law and order to our country. [GASPS] [LAUGHTER] Oh, we're not talking about the show? Oh, OK. Because I'm not sure that's ever left us. He's talking about law and order as a foundational principle of civilized society. So how does Donald Trump propose bringing law and order back? REPORTER: President Trump is publicly putting pressure on the Department of Justice and Attorney General Pam Bondi. In a post on Truth Social, the president said, ""What about Comey, Adam 'Shifty' Schiff, Leticia? They're all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to be done,"" adding, ""Justice must be served."" You post that? Publicly? Sir, far be it for me to tell you how to run your post-judicial lawfare. But do we all have to be copied on this shit? [LAUGHTER] We know-- we know you and Bondi talk in private. (FAKE-COUGHS) Epstein. Oh, I'm sorry. Ep-- Eps-- [FAKE-COUGHS] [CHEERS, APPLAUSE] I have a-- a Epstein's file-- a cold. I have a cold. [LAUGHTER] Now, most people would think a president ordering his independent Department of Justice to go after his political opponents is weaponizing the Department of Justice. That's why most people don't work in this administration. It is not weaponizing the Department of Justice to demand accountability for those who weaponized the Department of Justice. [LAUGHTER] Yes. This is lawfare, but this lawfare is only fair because of how he fared under-- I've run out of road for the metaphor. But I think you understand-- but, look, man, if Letitia James committed a crime, she should be held accountable. But what if she hadn't committed a crime? REPORTER: Trump forced out top federal prosecutor Erik Siebert after his office failed to find incriminating evidence against New York Attorney General Letitia James. He fi-- he fired him for not finding evidence that Trump is going full Devil Wears Prada on this one. I want an indictment for Letitia James on my desk, or you're fired! [LAUGHTER] But, Mr. Trump, it's 3:00 in the morning, and she didn't do anything. You woke [INDISTINCT] her! There's a thousand girls who would take your place in a second. And that sweater is pedestrian. [LAUGHTER] And so-- that's my-- I've never seen the movie, so I don't-- I-- if you've seen the movie, you'd probably go, I don't think that's the movie. By the way, this Siebert fella was appointed by Trump earlier this year. Look, at this point, it's so blatantly an abuse of power, and yet his defenders continue to reframe this as refreshing. He's asking his attorney general in a public way to go after his political enemies. Very open about it. You're OK with that? Well, I think what we know is President Trump is very open and transparent with the American people, and he speaks his mind. And that's what his supporters love about him, and that's what America loves about him. No, that's what America loves about Dolly Parton. [LAUGHTER] Transparent, speaks her mind. Yet Dolly rarely jails her political enemies. [LAUGHTER] I mean, Senator Markwayne-- Mark hyphen wayne backslash Mullin-- do you want to know how embarrassing your weak-kneed rationalization for jailing political opponents ring? I'm going to play you a clip of a fellow senator, a fellow Republican senator. [AUDIENCE EXCLAIMS] By the way, that's majority opinion, not just here. Now, Cruz has supported this president through insults to his own wife's looks and to his own father's loyalties. And yet Cruz still manages to maintain a modicum of self-respect when it comes to this president trampling all over our Constitution. Sir, it brings me no pleasure to have to play this. TED CRUZ (ON RECORDING): Look, I like Brendan Carr. He's a good guy. He's the chairman of the FCC. I work closely with him. But what he said there is dangerous as hell. Fantastic. Fantastic! [CHEERS, APPLAUSE] Senator Ted Cruz boldly stating that the FCC chairman threatening the licenses of networks is dangerous. And, Senator Cruz, I would just say, maybe you should stop there. I would stop there. I would not continue with the thought. Perfect. No notes. All right, go on. REPORTER: And I gotta say, he threatens it. He says, (BOSTON ACCENT) we could do this the easy way, or we could do this the hard way. [LAUGHTER] The [BLEEP]? We're talking about the hard way? [LAUGHTER] What kind of mobster have you ever heard. (GOOFY BOSTON ACCENT) we could do this the hard way. Uh, we could do it the easy way, the hard way? Easy or hard? (NORMAL VOICE) It's not The Godfather. That's Lennie from Mice and Men. (GOOFY BOSTON ACCENT) I-- I ain't your bunny. The bunny can do it the easy, the hard way. [LAUGHTER] (NORMAL VOICE) You got-- you got more, Senator, don't you? TED CRUZ (ON RECORDING): And I gotta say, that's right out of Goodfellas. (STAMMERING) That's right out of a mafioso coming into a bar going, (BOSTON ACCENT) nice bar you have here. It'd be a shame if something happened to it. [LAUGHTER] That's not a Goodfellas quote. [LAUGHTER] I know this because all of my decorative pillows have Goodfellas quotes on them. I mean, I would go home, I would say-- that's me at home. Look at me. [APPLAUSE] Now, Senator, a lesser man might tell you to go home and get your [BLEEP] shine box. But I don't, because you wouldn't even know what that means. Ted Cruz, I mean, to do that with Goodfellas, with that accent, is there anything in pop culture that I love that you can't ruin? (IMITATING LISA) But, Dad, I'm a vegetarian. I don't eat animals. (IMITATING HOMER) But, Lisa, animals are so delicious. There's the animal we get bacon from, the animal we get ham from, the animal we get sausage from. (IMITATING LISA) Dad, that's all the same animal. (IMITATING MR. BURNS) Smithers, release the hounds. Excellent. [LAUGHTER, BOOS] They're not booing. They're saying ""boo-urns."" [LAUGHTER] Imagine having to endure a Texas power outage with this guy. Who wants to hear my Apu? Anyone? [LAUGHTER] Well, he ruined my love of The Simpsons. At least I've still got my favorite franchise, Star Wars, all to myself, so I don't have to-- (DEEP VOICE) The force is strong with this one. Mm! There is no try. Do or do not. [LAUGHTER] At best, he sounds like Yoda with a sinus infection, trying not to come. [LAUGHTER] Do or do-- You may enjoy Star Wars, Ted Cruz, but there's one thing we'll never have in common. And that's my comfort movie, The Princess Bride, a fantastical tale of adventure and true love, with an outstanding cast and-- oh, you know what's coming. You know what's coming. With an outstanding cast, including the inimitable-- oh, [BLEEP] it. Just roll it. So what is it you have that's so worth living for? Presses on his chest, and-- and Wesley goes. True love. Liar! Shut up, witch! I'm not a witch. I'm your wife. But after what you just said, I wish I wasn't. Don't say that name. What? Humperdinck. Humperdinck, Humperdinck, Humperdinck. I can't hear you. So-- Wow. That was a straight-- I'm like, oh, the one-man show. [LAUGHTER] Do you know how hard it is to make Mario Lopez uncomfortable? [LAUGHTER] Truly, Mario Lopez, the man who, need I remind you, did this dance in a tank tee in front of everyone at the Maxx. [CHEERS] Look, I don't want to get sidetracked by Ted Cruz's Vegas residency. I just want to say this to Trump's defenders. You don't have to bend over backwards trying to make Trump's authoritarian power grabs seem like the rule of law. He does not give a [BLEEP] anymore. He's saying it straight up. Trump is saying, the people like dictators. Trump is saying, I hate my opponents, and I want them punished. And Trump is saying, I'll use all the levers of government at my disposal to accomplish that goal. So you can get on board with that and say, I'm with that, or you can join the rest of us and fight like hell for this constitutional republic. [CHEERS, APPLAUSE] Because let me tell you something. Let me tell you something. [APPLAUSE] Hold on. It is a form of representational government worth preserving and defending. And as the great Winston Churchill once said-- (IMITATING WINSTON CHURCHILL) We shall never surrender! Mother-[BLEEP]!"
k8j3N7dEwzY,Trump Sends Troops to Portland & Shootings Trigger Left-Right Blame Game | The Daily Show,The Daily Show,Political Commentary (Left),20250930,1071,4862331,135968,"Welcome to The Daily Show. My name is Jon Stewart. We have a fabulous show for you tonight. Historian and Professor Jill Lepore will be here later. [cheering] She's going to be discussing her latest book to discuss the Constitution of the United States-- or what remains of it. [laughter] Boy, we should have laminated that thing, huh? [grunts] Because, well, as many of you know out there, we had another just blessed weekend in America of chaos and carnage. There were six mass shootings in 24 hours-- two in North Carolina, two in Louisiana, one in Texas, the terrible scenes out of Michigan. But fear not, because the president is on the case. REPORTER: This morning, President Trump declares he's deploying troops to Portland, Oregon. Oh! Portland. You just missed it. You're going to want a little to the-- you're going-- you've got the right country. [laughter] But you're going to want to shift the-- why Portland? REPORTER: Trump posting, ""I'm directing Secretary of War Pete Hegseth to provide all necessary troops to protect war-ravaged Portland."" [laughter] [audience booing] Stop it. No no, no. People are-- uncontrollable, these people. [laughter] In the orgy of mass shootings in America-- Portland? Did I miss Vancouver attacking Portland in a fierce battle of mellow artisans? (IN STRANGE ACCENT) Don't shoot 'til you see the whites of their cold foam, half-caf latte art. [laughter] (IN REGULAR ACCENT) I'm not sure what that accent was, by the way. Here's the craziest part. The people of Oregon-- Portland in particular-- were also caught off guard by this. And the governor of Oregon tried to explain to the president that they were not in a state of war. And the president's response was-- well, it was telling. REPORTER: President Trump, in an interview with NBC on Sunday morning, said a phone call with Governor Kottak showed him a different perspective, saying, ""I spoke to the governor. She was very nice. But I said, well, wait a minute. Am I watching things on television that are different from what's happening?"" [laughter] A. I don't think any of us know what you're watching on television. [laughter] But if it's Game   of Thrones, I'd say yes. Conditions in Portland may vary. And B, this explains so much about the governing philosophy of the Trump administration. There is reality. And then there's this. REPORTER: ""My people tell me different. They are literally attacking, and there are fires all over the place."" And dragons. [laughter] There be dragons. So the President of the United States, alone in his be-screened bunker, sees reports of conflict in Portland on TV. His lackeys reinforce the chaos. And rather than take a breath, rather than take a beat, rather than not acting rashly, rather than using the resources available to him as the president of the United States to find out what the realities on the ground are, he just goes, code red. Red team go. Because he sees it on [bleep] TV and acts impulsively. He sends out the National Guard the same way you or I might make a late night ShamWow purchase. I saw it on TV. It looked-- it was on TV. [cheering] In reality, it's just a [bleep] rag. But at 3:00 in the morning-- [laughter] --it's magic. Meanwhile, the non-Portland area of the country is going through some shit. As we mentioned, there's a mass shooting now like, every couple of hours. Previously, the routine would be we express our shock. We express our sadness. We offer our thoughts and prayers. We spend a day, maybe two, arguing about the appropriateness of bringing up guns at all. And then we do nothing until the next time. But as our politics becomes more polarized, even that learned cycle of helplessness has been replaced by a new post-shooting pastime. That new pastime is, was this one of yours? The shooter was a radical leftist. REPORTER: The guy is a right-wing Trump-supporting evangelical Christian. He is a Biden supporter, case closed. We know the suspected shooter is MAGA. REPORTER: The shooter, a leftist whack job. It's America's new gender reveal tradition. Boom, it's blue. Ha, ha. I'm so happy to blame the left for the violence. The game is so ubiquitous, now we often play it before we even know who the perpetrator is. The killer's identity may be unknown, but his point of view seems pretty clear. That's why I'm calling it political and from the left. That's Kudlow's lock of the week. Lock it up. Next, murder rate in Chicago next weekend-- well, it's getting cold there, so I'm taking the under. [laughter] By the way, playing, Was this one of yours? is also certainly a speculative endeavor. So we are treated in the aftermath of these horrific crimes to the news media's active, politicized scavenger hunt. Which piece of inconclusive arcana proves which half of the country is to blame? The shooter reportedly voted in the 2020 Democratic primary. The Butler, Pennsylvania, shooter was a registered Republican. REPORTER: The suspect wasn't registered with either party. REPORTER: He grew up in an area of Utah that is mostly Republican. The shooter was a registered Republican while election records show that in 2021, he gave $15 to a Democratic-aligned organization. [laughter] He's a Republican but cheap? [laughter] Republican but donated to a Democrat? Maybe he just wanted the PBS Ken Burns tote bag. I don't know. I don't know who to hate. Sometimes the clues aren't even expressly political but live politically adjacent in the culture. REPORTER: Social media photos show Mr. Robinson shooting and posing with guns. REPORTER: There's his pickup truck, the huge American flags. This person was a gay man who was in a relationship with another man who believed he was a woman. And they were both into a phenomenon that can only be described as furriness. [laughter] I love that this dude has to pretend like he doesn't know what furries are. [laughter] I mean, uh, it can be only-- I don't know. [applause] It can only be described as a sexual costume party with animals. I mean-- I mean, if you were going to do something like that, how would you even get the stains out of the costumes? I mean, especially if they had set for three days. What would you use? Club soda, lemon? I'm just asking. [laughter] Or do you just throw the costume out after each experience? Now, call me old fashioned, but I miss the good old days of mass shootings, when networks took a principled stance to not shower attention on acts designed to get attention. We will not say the gunman's name or show his photograph. REPORTER: Fox News will not show you his picture or give him any attention by repeating his name. We don't like naming the gunman because so often, they do things just to get attention. We don't want to bring more undue attention than is absolutely necessary to the cowards that bring out, carry out these types of attacks. (IN ELDERLY VOICE) That's right, boys and girls, you know. When I was a boy, there was a brief period in American media where not only wouldn't they say the suspected killer's name, they wouldn't constantly show the suspected killer's OnlyFans hot shots. They wouldn't do it. They wouldn't-- oh, dear Lord. Oh. Oh my god. [applause] [grunts] He could have so-- he could have done so much good with those. And yet, he chose the dark side. Ooh. [laughter] So why has the news media become obsessed with right, left framing of violence? Well, part of the reason is, they are following the lead of social media. Social media is doing it crazier and faster than anybody else. So the media is trying to keep up. The fire in the church in Michigan was still burning when online influencers were inferring that the number of Muslims in Michigan are what obviously made this attack happen-- until police released the suspect's photo, which looked like it came from a Duck Dynasty fanfic account. And then the left got to celebrate. And then they found a Trump-Vance sign on his house-- case closed-- except that sign was placed near a stop sign. So some on the right said, no, no, no. He's saying stop Trump, Vance, like it's some leftist Rebus that he was creating. But here's the thing. Who the [bleep] cares? These mass shootings don't fit-- who honestly cares? [applause] These mass shootings do not fit neatly into our left-right paradigm. Mass shootings are probably caused by a complex fusion of mental health and access to weapons and attention-seeking, delusional nihilism married to an algorithmic underworld that sets these horrific acts in motion. But unfortunately, right-left paradigm is the only way our narcissistic media ecosystem sees anything anymore. That's the system they built. So it must fit into the right-left paradigm, because that binary is the foundation of all of their programming. So that helps them pretend that the solution to this violence is a simple change in our right-left rhetoric. The violent rhetoric that is coming from the extreme right wing. Democratic Party, they are not just tolerating political violence, they are cultivating it. The right wing has gotten so incensed, so dangerously violent, at least in its rhetoric. What is your message to your fellow Democrats in Congress? Stop with the rhetoric. You're getting people killed. I don't think the rhetoric is getting people killed, honestly. I don't think any of these psychotic mother-[bleep] that are doing this are watching MSNBC. I mean, I'm only judging from the ratings. I'm almost positive they're not watching it. To suggest that we don't need to tackle any complex, deep-rooted issues haunting American society, we just need to stop saying a few choice bad words and all our mentally broken young men will be fine is not realistic. And I'm pretty sure that these people don't believe that either. When you equate federal agents with literal Nazis, you're no longer offering an opinion. You are giving permission to escalate. Mm, permission to escalate, right. So dangerous. So-- This is what Hitler did with the SS. This is what Nazi Joseph Goebbels said about the Hitler Youth. Nazi tactics are progressive tactics first. Permission to escalate granted. Look. In America, we disagree. That's fine. That's the democratic process. But your political opponents are not Nazis. Except when-- The Democrats, they are authoritarians. They are jackbooted thugs. Ooh. No, no, he's not calling them Nazis. I'm sure that's just a fashion critique. Jackbooted thugs-- I mean, those boots and white pants in October? Are you mad? [laughter] Only Hitler would pull something like that off. Look, getting our arms around why this is happening is maddening and scary. But the media's ability to memory hole mass shootings that they can't neatly fit into right left is almost as maddening as not really knowing why these killings are really happening, even when the suspected killers leave supposedly explicit cues on their bullets. One inscription read, ""Hey, fascist! Catch!"" Giving some indication about the mindset of Tyler Robinson. All right. No, it's very clearly anti-fascist, very clear. Unless-- was there anything written on the other bullets? ""If you read this, you are gay. LMAO."" OK, that seems kind of homophobic to me. ""If you read this, you're gay."" I don't know what that means. [laughter] Well, read it again. [laughter] [applause] It means-- yeah, it's got to mean something. REPORTER: New York City College meme and digital culture researcher we spoke to said could refer to a video game called Helldivers 2,  the same for other inscriptions found on an up arrow, right arrow, and three down arrows, which is how you drop a bomb in that game. What the [bleep] are we even-- the world that these kids now live in is so cynical and impermeable, this online nether world. If only there were a man, one man, a man who looks square but is hep to what these kids are laying down, man-- REPORTER: There's a lot talk about the chat platform, Discord. And Kurt the CyberGuy joins us now to tell us what Discord is. [laughter] [applause] Oh. Kurt the CyberGuy guy has shown up, fresh off of doing the weather in Sarasota. [laughter] Thanks for the lowdown, Kurt the CyberGuy, you old cyber dog. Say hello to your partner in crime, Meme Maven Gary. Meanwhile, why are we all just taking the bait from these psychos? Authorities have not released the motive. But of course, here's the ammunition, the words anti-ICE, that phrase hyphenated, written on one of the bullet casings. We just had the facts laid out for us. This was an individual motivated by anti-ICE. He wrote it on a bullet. We saw the bullet yesterday, anti-ICE. Case closed. He wrote anti-- doesn't anybody think it's [bleep] weird that these people just started writing on bullets all of a sudden, like that's the most effective way to get out their deeply-held political beliefs? Anti-ICE, enough said. Or is there the slightest possibility that these people are [bleep] with us? REPORTER: According to his friends, the alleged gunman was not overly political and was mainly interested in video games and internet culture. Clearly, it's anti-ICE, right? And his friends say, I wouldn't interpret it that way. He was never a sincere guy. Everything he said was laced with irony and sarcasm. What kind of [bleep] psychotic internet culture-- what's happening? Can't we just go back to the cinnamon challenge? Is that so hard? What is wrong with you-- look, we would definitely have a healthier political discourse if we weren't constantly calling each other fascists and communists and Nazis. But we are the only place in the world where this shit happens all the time. But we're not the only place in the world that name calls. So what is this? Perhaps we need to look back at our founders, who, through their infinite wisdom, designed and operated a more mature system with checks and balances and a respect for all that prevented this kind of corrosive infighting and radicalization. REPORTER: John Quincy Adams taking aim at Jackson, asserting that Jackson didn't know how to spell, was too uneducated to become president, while newspapers portrayed his wife, Rachel, as a short, fat dumpling. [laughter] A delicious dumpling indeed."
hlS5um3WJqg,"Hegseth Lectures ""Fat Generals"" and Trump Threatens War Against U.S. Cities | The Daily Show",,Political Commentary (Left),20251001,703,4528492,106103,"Welcome to The Daily Show. I'm Ronny Chieng. We got so much to talk about tonight. Pete Hegseth has his own battle of the Bulge. The National Guard adds more tour dates. And I bet you $50 gambling is going to destroy American society. So let's get into the headlines. [LIVELY MUSIC] # # Let's start with America's military, the Karen of the world. They just will not stay out of other countries' business. And leading this military is Pete Hegseth, who you might think is the Secretary of Defense. But you'd be wrong. He's rebranded himself the Secretary of War. [ELECTRIC GUITAR RIFF] You know how cool guys always give themselves nicknames. And as part of this military makeover, last week, the secretary announced a surprise meeting. REPORTER: Tonight in an unprecedented move, Secretary Pete Hegseth asking all US general officers and admirals around the world to gather at the US Marine base in Quantico, Virginia. A meeting of this size in person and on such short notice is extremely rare. REPORTER: It's going to also potentially be a security risk, given the sheer number of military officials and how many are going to be gathered in one place at a time. Listen, we all do weird things when we're drunk, OK? Some of us slide into an ex's DMs, and some of us call every US general to a meeting at Quantico. But, you know, I'm sure if the secretary is going to gather all the generals, some of them from active war zones, then he must have something very important he wants to tell them. It's tiring to look out at combat formations, or really any formation, and see fat troops. Likewise, it's completely unacceptable to see fat generals and admirals in the halls of the Pentagon. [LAUGHTER] That's what you dragged all these generals in for, to tell them they're fat? Couldn't you just leave some passive-aggressive comments on their Instagram, like, hey, congrats, general, when are you due? I mean, this guy will text top-secret war plans, but when it comes to body shaming, he's like, I want to see their fat faces when I tell them how fat their faces are. Look, I get the military needs to be fit, OK? But in defense of fat generals, they're kind of like coaches, right? Like, coaches don't need to be fit enough to play the sport. They just have to be fit enough to date a 24-year-old. And-- [CROWD SHOUTS] And also, there are some military positions you kind of don't want a fit soldier for. Like, I don't want a guy with six-pack abs operating a drone. He clearly hasn't had enough time and experience sitting down like this with a controller, just going, OK, he's dead. But telling generals they have to get on Ozempic wasn't the whole speech. America's Secretary of War-- [ELECTRIC GUITAR RIFF] --had more to say than that. No more beards, long hair, superficial individual expression. We're going to cut our hair, shave our beards, and adhere to standards. OK, you hear that, you goddamn hippie generals? No more beards. I'm looking at you, Admiral Lebowski. [LAUGHTER] Now, according to Pete Hegseth, America's military standards are now going to be indistinguishable from a grinder profile, OK? No fatties, no facial hair, and get those ladies the [BLEEP] out of my sight. But it's all about a much larger project of de-woke-ificationing. An entire generation of generals and admirals were told that they must parrot the insane fallacy that, quote, ""our diversity is our strength."" They had to put out dizzying DEI and LGBTQI-plus statements. No more identity months, DEI offices, dudes in dresses. Yeah, you hear that, General Doubtfire? [LAUGHTER] Something very weird about that, general. I just can't-- I can't put my finger on it. Although are we sure dudes wearing dresses doesn't work? Because the Taliban wore dresses, and it kind of worked for them. You know what I mean? Like, I don't know. Maybe the beards cancel out the dresses. Someone check the math on that. But this wasn't just a pep talk. Pete Hegseth, the mother-- [BLEEP] Secretary of mother-- [BLEEP] War-- [ELECTRIC GUITAR RIFF] --also took the opportunity to bump his book sales on Amazon. You might say we're ending the war on warriors. I heard someone wrote a book about that. [CROWD SHOUTS AND BOOS] Yeah. And that someone was him. Say what you want about Henry Kissinger. I mean, at least he never used his position to sell his book, 101 War Crimes to Try on Cambodians. But bottom line, a lot of people were worried that this event was going to show that Pete Hegseth had taken over the military. But he actually just showed how disconnected his MAGA rally energy is from their professional culture, especially this moment that he clearly thought was going to crush. Should our enemies choose foolishly to challenge us, they will be crushed by the violence, precision, and ferocity of the War Department. In other words, to our enemies, FAFO. If necessary, our troops can translate that for you. [LAUGHTER] Wow. Not even the leaders of the US military have ever seen a line bomb that hard before. It's just kind of-- it's weird and some would say juvenile to use internet slang in a speech to your adversaries. I mean, President Reagan was never like, Mr. Gorbachev, I hawk tua spit on that wall. [LAUGHTER] But basically, that was Pete Hegseth's speech-- FAFO, and no one in the military is allowed to be fat, especially the leaders. It's a bad look. So next up to speak was the famously thin health nut, Commander-in-Chief Donald Trump. And-- [APPLAUSE, CHEERING] And even President Trump noticed how dead the room was. [LAUGHTER] Wow, way to throw your opening act under the bus. Who was that lead? Who was that loser, huh? I thought alcoholics were supposed to be fun. Well, if anyone can win a room back, it's President Trump, who convinced these generals there was a good reason to pull them from their posts. [CROWD SHOUTS] Oh, shit. He's coming in hot here. Is he-- Is he going to, like-- Is he going to say-- Is he going to say the thing? Is this about to happen? Is this it? Oh. OK, the N-word is ""nuclear."" OK, but that's a weird way to say it, since there's also kind of another word that we famously refer to as the N-word. [LAUGHTER] Wait. Are we still talking about nuclear or-- or the other one? I-- I-- I just want to make sure. Ugh. Look, I'm sure the gathering of America's most decorated generals is loving this extended riff on the N-word. But let's maybe wrap this up before it gets out of hand. control. - OK, OK. You know what. Can we just go back to talking about the N-word, OK? Because this is-- this seems worse. So is that what this whole thing was about, giving these generals their marching orders for war against American cities? That's some pretty dark and scary shit from the president and the Secretary of War. [ELECTRIC GUITAR RIFF] No! No! Stop with the-- No. Not now. No shredding. Shredding for good stuff only, not bad stuff. Look, I've only officially been American for, like, a few hours now. But even-- even I know that using American cities as a training ground for the military is kind of messed up. And I don't think that's what American soldiers signed up to do. So if you're going to rope them into your authoritarian fantasies, at the very least, you should at least change the recruitment ads. [PATRIOTIC MUSIC] ANNOUNCER: Your great-grandfather fought Hitler. Your grandfather fought the Communists. And now you'll be called upon to take on America's greatest enemy, Portland. If you're a tough young man with 0% body fat, the US Army wants to shave you clean. Then we'll fly you to hostile lands like New York and Chicago, where you'll defend America from people who make fun of our president. Your pappy fought German panzers. You'll fight this guy, that lady who won't move her car, and anyone with a nose ring. When history calls, you will send it to voicemail because you're shaving. While you wait for Antifa, you'll keep busy by picking up trash, then clear out a homeless camp, another homeless camp, and then clear out the first one again. Then a quick clean up shave and back to your post. Wait, did you get your neck? Quick shave and we're back. Do you have what it takes to defeat hordes of demonic agents of chaos? Then join the Department of War today-- strength, honor, integrity, no fatties. Because we want you. Shave that man! [BUZZING]"
N4rkUhA4_AE,Jon Stewart Makes the Case for Dems Holding the Line in Trump's Shutdown Warfare | The Daily Show,The Daily Show,Political Commentary (Left),20251007,1330,3997696,120137,"Welcome to The Daily Show. My name is Jon Stewart. Man, man, and I say this a lot, and this time, though, seriously, I mean it. I haven't meant it in the past. We've got a great show for you tonight. We truly do. Tonight we do. Later on, we'll be joined by technology ethicist Tristan Harris. He co-founded the Center for Humane Technology, which involves the free-range raising and also, unfortunately, slaughtering of iPhones. But first, let's get into our ongoing coverage of shutdown, showdown 2025. [APPLAUSE, CHEERING] Locked up, locked down, and closed for business. Yes. Today is day six of the government shutdown. As you know, it lasts for eight days. [LAUGHTER] I may be confusing that with Hanukkah. But so far, the effects of the shutdown keep getting worse. REPORTER: Millions of Americans this morning feeling the pain, experiencing delays at airports. Food benefits to moms and young children could dry up in days. And national parks and monuments are partially closed. I don't want to hardship shame anyone. But there is a significant gap between partially closed monuments and your children will starve. Old people will be forced to eat their pets. And the Department of Treasury thermostats will have to be kept at 66. Wear a sweater. I mean, really, who's taking a hit on the monument thing? REPORTER: This tourist, David, all the way from Italy, saying Alcatraz was supposed to be the highlight of his visit to the Bay. I feel not good that because I come from Italy for, say, Alcatraz, all the attraction. And now we can't. Then it's not good feeling, not good. [LAUGHTER] Growing up in my country. I was a little boy, bambino. And I say it to my friends, tomorrow, someday, someday I'm going to travel, not of the 3,000 miles, not of the 5,000 miles, over the 6,000 miles to see one day a notorious prison turned into a museum. And when I get there, and oh, I will get there, when I get to this notorious prison turned a museum, on my father's life, I am going to buy a shard of glass, a shard of glass with-- mother, if this could happen, a shard of glass with the name of the prison frosted under the glass. And my friends, as a kid, they said to me, hey, Enzo, this is a big plan. When this happens, maybe you should check the website. And then maybe you-- you should make sure it's still open. You happy, government? Look what you did! Look what you did to the poor fella! Yes, all! If Liberals had their way, he'd be hosting the halftime show at the Super Bowl. Yeah, liberals! The poor guy from Italy, he just wants-- oh, I just want to visit a museum. But if the fat cats in DC would just get out of their Beltway bubble, they'd hear from real common-sense Americans about how to end this troubling shutdown. Lock them up in a room until they come to an agreement. Don't let them out. [LAUGHTER] I did-- I did not see that coming. Obviously, the shutdown is personal to Mr. Fester on disability and his hand companion, a data analyst with the Department of Labor management. Obviously, if the shutdown continues, he will be forced to return to giving hand jobs in truck stop bathrooms. Do not shame sex work! Do not shame sex work! He's going to have a tough enough time at the truck stop. Oh, hey, Handy! I guess that degree didn't work out so well, did it, college boy? Now stop [FINGERSNAPS] snapping and start tugging. [LAUGHTER] You know, the bathroom hand job, I was really looking forward to since the shutdown. Now, as you'll recall, the shutdown began because in order to pass a budget bill in the Senate, you need 60 votes, as the founders never mentioned. And so, Democrats have come forth with a laundry list of demands to force the Republicans-- I'm just kidding. They want, like, two things. REPORTER: Democrats demanding that Republicans reverse cuts to Medicaid and extend expiring Obamacare subsidies to prevent insurance premiums from rising for some 20 million Americans. Those bastards. It's, like, they don't even want people to die of generally preventable diseases. I wonder what the seemingly reasonable and narrow request will sound like when put through the Fox-ometer. American taxpayers' hard-earned dollars would be paying for benefits for illegal aliens. To extend policy that gives millions of illegal aliens free health care? Health care for illegals, transgender surgery. Well, what? Did you-- wait. Did you just transgender surgery, illegal immigrant health care just through transgender? Transgender, it's not just the garnish you add to every talking point. Like, you're some transgender salt bae. Oh, are you talking about health care for illegals? That needs a little trans surgery. And while people in the country legally are not eligible for Medicaid or for Obamacare subsidies, point taken. But the Democrats aren't lily-livered about this one. They've got their own rhetorical arguments about the popularity of extending these subsidies that I think you'll find compelling. Democrats are adamant that we must protect the health care of the American people. [LAUGHTER] Good points. Not crazy about this. Solid framing delivered with clarity. [LAUGHTER] Really could have done without the whole, Americans demand. It's just not-- but if you had stopped there, that would be great. But you're going to keep talking, aren't you? Aren't you? New data came out today from KFF, and that is not Kentucky Fried French fries, KFF. Could be Kentucky French Fries, hmm? I just can't. I know. Hmm? Who is that joke even for? Six-year-olds that watch C-span? What the [BLEEP] are you doing? Chuck Schumer is a human flat tire. You just can't-- Kentucky Fried French fry. Look at-- look at Klobuchar, poor Klobuchar. That is the face of someone who talked to their dad, who said, just please, don't do your Indian accent in the restaurant. That's all I'm asking. But then dad was, like, chicken tikka masala. And he looks at her, and he's like, I'm killing. But miracle of miracles, despite talking points being delivered by Hackie Mason here, Republicans are feeling pressured to defend their health care intentions. And House Speaker Mike Johnson is more than up to the task of reassuring America that to serve man is not a cookbook but, in fact, a totally innocent double meaning. Let me look right into the camera and tell you very clearly, Republicans are the ones concerned about health care. Republicans are the party working around the clock every day to fix health care. [AUDIENCE BOOS] No, no. It's OK. That's not technically looking right into the camera. [LAUGHTER] Technically, I'm doing that right now. I'm looking right into the camera right now. You saying ""I'm going to look right at you"" and then never looking at us suggests a little struggling with the conscience and the truth. Your Honor, let me be clear. It was a consensual use of baby oil. [LAUGHTER] Was-- no, I had to buy cases of it because it spoils. But, you know, Republicans have always been very sincere about being the party of great health care. We are going to be submitting in a couple of weeks a great health care plan that's going to take the place of the disaster known as Obamacare. Boom! And while that was only nine years ago, to be fair, when they promised to release their health care plan, they didn't realize how controversial it would be. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS, APPLAUSE] Back then, he drew titties on everything. [LAUGHTER] It seems like after eight long months, the Democrats finally have themselves a specific ask, finally have themselves a small amount of leverage to accomplish this specific ask and an ask that is somewhat popular with the American people, which means clearly this is a mistake. I call upon my colleagues in the Republican Party to explain why. I think Mr. Schumer made a mistake. I think he marched his troops up into a box canyon. I don't know what that means. [LAUGHTER] Yes, is Charles Schumer shrewdly protecting health care premiums, or is he Custer at his last stand? [LAUGHTER] Any whimsical folksy but not massacre-y folksy? Once you shut down government, you've got to figure out how to get it back open. A wise person once said, if you pray for rain, you gotta be prepared to deal with the mud. [LAUGHTER] Touché. [LAUGHTER] Who was that wise sage who said that? Confucius? A bard of the South, perhaps? Lear? When you pray for rain, you gotta deal with the mud, too. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS, APPLAUSE] Well done, sir. Throughout all these obscure colloquialisms, can the news media cut through, what is exactly the concern If Democrats stand on principle? Do you worry your fellow Democrats are walking into a trap? Democrats just marched into a shutdown trap. I think they walked into a trap.  --stepping into a trap.  --stright into a trap. It's a trap! [LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE] I have to come clean about something. I added that last clip in there. [LAUGHTER, CHEERS] You're Welcome. And let me say this, and I mean this sincerely. Adding ""it's a trap"" is probably not fair to the media or to the larger discussion of our troubled health care system. But mostly, I believe, adding that clip isn't fair to Admiral Ackbar. [LAUGHTER] Admiral Ackbar served this galaxy with distinction. He does not deserve to have such a distinguished career reduced to one catchphrase or a flippant punchline. Gial Ackbar rose from the hardscrabble backwaters of Coral Depths City to lead the Mon Calamarians in rebellion against the empire, a perilous and fraught journey where Akbar once had to escape capture during the Quarren insurgency to lead his forces to the decisive victory at the storied Battle of Jakku. [LAUGHTER] A hero like that deserves to be remembered for his accomplishments, for his bravery, for his service, and for his sacrifice. And by the way, all of that information was brought to you by You're Never Getting Laid. [LAUGHTER, CHEERS] Yes! You're never getting laid. If you recognize any of that shit that I just talked about, you're never getting laid! [LAUGHTER, CHEERS] And if you think learning any of that information about Admiral Ackbar will get you laid-- It's a trap! Exactly! [CHEERS, APPLAUSE] Today's episode is like four one-man shows. [LAUGHTER] By the way, we didn't even defi-- what is the trap the Democrats have walked themselves into? REPORTER: President Trump warning mass layoffs of federal workers are coming. We'd be laying off a lot of people that are going to be very affected, and they're Democrats. They're going to be Democrats. A lot of good can come down from shutdowns. We can get rid of a lot of things that we didn't want, and they'd be Democrat things. REPORTER: Trump writing, ""I can't believe the radical left Democrats gave me this unprecedented opportunity. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. So the trap is, if the Democrats shut down the government, Donald Trump takes advantage of the situation and begins to, I don't know, trim programs Democrats care about. Or maybe Donald Trump might let go of some federal workers. Or Donald Trump might eliminate funding, but only for blue states. Or Donald Trump might [BLEEP] send in the National Guard, but only into blue areas. In other words, to continue doing all this shit, Trump has not needed any provocation or pretense or reason to already have been doing. Lo these past, God, it feels like [BLEEP] 80 years. And yet somehow the Republicans have the balls to continue to insist that the secondhand urine on our legs is rain. It is a regrettable situation that but the president does not want. Democrats are the ones who have decided to inflict the pain, not the president. The president-- the president takes no pleasure in this. Bullshit! The president takes no pleasure in this? The president takes only pleasure. Given the president's vascular condition, this might be the only thing keeping him hard. I swear to you. His catchphrase was literally ""you're fired."" His only reason for getting up in the morning is vengeance. Trump has been steamrolling over the Democrats and the law so consistently since day one of the presidency, the nation's pundits and legal experts are running out of ways to describe it. The legality of this is very much unclear.  --some sort of legal gray area.  --extraordinarily shaky legal ground.  --not technically currently illegal. There's a lot of questionable legality.  --considered by legal experts to be legally dubious. While Trump is not technically violating the law, he's violating the spirit of our laws. [LAUGHTER] Word to the wise, especially those programming sometimes rather technical and dense discussions of legal issues, you're going to want to leave the donut B-roll on the floor. [LAUGHTER] But trying to listen to a lawyer the whole time, I'm like, is he going to hit that mother-[BLEEP]? [LAUGHTER] Look, man, 75 million Americans voted for a Democrat in this last round of presidential elections, and at this moment, they have zero power at the federal level-- not in the House, not in the Senate, not in the executive, and not in the courts. There has not been a moment of conciliation or concern about the issues and policies that drove those 75 million votes, not a moment. At present, the Democrats largest victory over these past eight months is getting a guy who may or may not be a criminal back from El Salvador so Trump could send him to Uganda. That was the big win. And then suddenly a small ask for people's preservation of health care is a Molotov tough cocktail. Because apparently Republicans won't be satisfied with 99.8% domination. They must have it all. ICE went from deporting the worst of the worst to throwing grandmothers onto linoleum and zip-tying American children. And everyone's just supposed to be cool with the new, masked, incredibly well-funded paramilitary group, and Democrats are just reduced to petty gestures of restroom resistance. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posted that she was blocked from entering a city building in Illinois. Victory is ours! [CHEERS, APPLAUSE] Look, I've given Democrats an enormous amount of shit for their poor leadership. Lack of specific and actionable plans, terrible messaging, abysmal wordplay. Did I mention poor leadership? But standing up for 75 million Americans in this moment to defend the rights of people to go into a little less medical debt seems like the least they can [BLEEP] do. And perhaps-- [CHEERS, APPLAUSE] And perhaps maybe that will remind the Republicans that their mandate wasn't 100%. They've just caught a constitutional, administrative, and logistics break. Because if this continues, as a wise man once said--  --it's a feeling a-not a good."
K7otv-HjT44,Trump Blames the Left for Charlie Kirk's Assassination as Rhetoric Escalates | The Daily Show,The Daily Show,Political Commentary (Left),20250912,594,2637703,73837,"By now, you guys all know about yesterday's assassination of Charlie Kirk. And this probably goes without saying, but I feel like I have to say it. I believe killing people is wrong. And I know that's a hot take. But as of now, we don't know who did it. But Kash Patel's FBI is on the case, so we will never know who did it. [LAUGHTER] This is as good a time as any to say political violence is never acceptable and should be condemned. And thankfully, many political leaders think the same. All four former presidents are reacting to the death of Charlie Kirk. Joe Biden posting on X, quote, ""There is no place in our country for this kind of violence."" Barack Obama shared a similar sentiment, writing, ""This kind of despicable violence has no place in our democracy."" And a statement as well from George W. Bush, who said this. ""Members of other political parties are not our enemies. They are our fellow citizens."" And a message from Bill Clinton, who says he, ""hopes we all go through some serious introspection and redouble our efforts to engage in debate passionately yet peacefully."" Yeah, and let's not get sidetracked by who may or may not have been friends with Jeffrey Epstein. Just focus on the introspection thing. But yes, it was comforting to see our living past presidents-- and Joe Biden-- attempting to lower the country's temperature yesterday. But none of those guys are running this place right now. So I want to hear from the current big guy. For years, those on the radical left have compared wonderful Americans like Charlie to Nazis and the world's worst mass murderers and criminals. This kind of rhetoric is directly responsible for the terrorism that we're seeing in our country today. My fellow Americans, we must come together to destroy each other. So, yeah, Donald Trump came out with a partisan message blaming the left. And let's be real, did we expect anything different? This is what this guy does. The last time Trump delivered a thoughtful message was apparently when he sent a birthday card to Jeffrey Epstein. [LAUGHTER] Yeah, that's-- [CHEERING] I realize that's two Epstein jokes in a row. It's not my fault everyone was friends with this guy. [LAUGHTER] And by the way, I'm not singling Trump out. This is how our society behaves now. A tragedy occurs. Instead of digesting and trying to understand, everyone sets their feet and starts throwing punches immediately, like Nancy Mace, Republican Congresswoman and somehow the scariest type of Mace. [LAUGHTER] She came out swinging but apparently wasn't expecting a counter. I'm going to say this. Democrats own what happened today. By that logic, do Republicans own the shooting of the two Democratic lawmakers in Minnesota? Political-- Isn't this on both sides? Are you kidding me? But isn't there a problem with-- Democrats own this.  --political violence across the spectrum? Yeah, we're talking about Charlie Kirk right now. Yeah, OK. We're talking about my thing right now, not about things that make me look stupid. Because if we did that, we'd be talking all day long. [LAUGHTER] All right, now, we're all-- [CHEERING] And now we're in very familiar territory. Republican accuses Democrat, so Democrat accuses Republican. REPORTER: What do you say to people who are saying that Democrats need to lower the temperatures? Oh, please. REPORTER: You know-- Right, why don't you start with the President of the United States. So here we go again. It's-- [CHEERING] It's Democrats' rhetoric. No, it's Republicans' rhetoric. Has anyone considered that the problem of political violence in America might not just be the rhetoric but instead something extraordinarily complex? The problem might be a toxic mix of our gun laws, lack of mental health, collapsed social connection, probably a bunch of other things I haven't even thought of yet. I'm sure the Labubus are somewhere in there to blame. [LAUGHTER] I guess I just don't think rhetoric is the root cause of this thing. Political violence isn't going to go away if the people on the other side say exactly the right words from now on. Now, that said, if you turned on the 24/7 news coverage yesterday, you probably saw some unhelpful rhetoric. He's been one of the most divisive, especially divisive younger figures, in this who is constantly sort of pushing this sort of hate speech or aimed at certain groups. And I always go back to hateful thoughts lead to hateful words, which then lead to hateful actions. And I think that's the environment we're in that people just-- you can't stop with these sort of awful thoughts you have and then saying these awful words and not expect awful actions to take place. I don't know, man. The whole idea of free speech in America is you can say what you want and not expect to be shot. Can you be challenged? [CHEERING] [APPLAUSE] Can you be challenged? Sure. Can you get roasted online? Sometimes. Told to leave a child's birthday party? Yeah, even though I think I was right that the cake [BLEEP] sucked, Derek. [LAUGHTER] That was hardly only the bad take. Even some people understood that a cycle of violence was not the answer. They still wanted to make sure you knew who'd be coming out on top. The last thing I ever want is violence. Look, I spent nine years in and out of war. The last thing I want is that. But if these people keep pushing, they're going to radicalize a huge portion of America that they don't want. I want us to be able to debate like Charlie Kirk always did on every campus, gave the airtime to opposing views. I want that as my America, not trading gunfire because I'll win. [AUDIENCE GROANING] You could have just stopped with the last thing I want is violence. You didn't have to add in because I'll win. But I guess it's like Jesus always said, turn the other cheek, but be ready to cut a mother [BLEEP]. [LAUGHTER] But by the way, who's they? No one knows who the shooter is or what his motivation was. And even if it was political, he doesn't represent half the country. But some of these MAGA guys are acting like this is a liberal declaration of war. If they could do this, they are capable of anything. I think that was the message. I believe that was the message. It's really hard to radicalize Republicans. It's like we're not the radical type [LAUGHTER] I'm sorry. First off, it's not that hard to radicalize Republicans. You guys almost burned down the country because Cracker Barrel changed its fonts. [LAUGHTER] Second, far be it for me to tell anyone how to do their job, but you couldn't lose the poop emoji mug for one day? [LAUGHTER] When Walter Cronkite broke the news about the Kennedy assassination, he didn't come out in a wacky novelty bow tie. [SLIGHT GROANS] I did not expect a groan from the audience on the novelty bow tie. [LAUGHTER] And also, once again, who is they? Does anyone want to specify who they is, or are we just going to keep talking about all that they do? They are at war with us. Whether we want to accept it or not, they are at war with us. Trump gets hit in the ear. Charlie gets shot dead. They came after Kavanaugh with a rifle to his neighborhood. They went after Musk's cars. [LAUGHTER] Sort of petered out there at the end, Jesse. If you're trying to rile people up for war, maybe leave out the car vandalism, I mean. [LAUGHTER] Look, I'm sure people in the media would love to talk about how they are responsible for what they've done and how they had better watch out, or else they'll get what's coming to them. But I think it would be better if we as a country understood that we have a problem with political violence. And we need to start thinking less in terms of what they should do and more in terms of what we have to do. [APPLAUSE] It's not lost on me today that the last time it felt like we thought in terms of we was on 9/11 when we all came together as a nation. And we did. We did. [APPLAUSE] Even if it was just for one day. Sure, we turned pretty quickly to scapegoating Muslims and blogging about how Bush did it. But on that one day, we were united as a country. For 24 hours, we even admired Rudy Giuliani. That's how incredible our unity was. [LAUGHTER] And I don't know what you do to get back to that. Obviously not another 9/11. I want to be very clear about that. But what about, I don't know, an alien invasion? [LAUGHTER] Maybe if UFOs suddenly appeared over every important US city and also Los Angeles, that's the thing that would jolt us off our phones and bring us back together. Or the aliens take over and enslave us all. But at this point, that might be worth a try. All right?"
pSWF7iOP9Ww,Charlie Kirk Criticism Ignites MAGA Cancel Culture Spree | The Daily Show,The Daily Show,Political Commentary (Left),20250917,637,2437517,60438,"Welcome to The Daily Show. I'm Desi Lydic. We've got so much to talk about tonight. Someone needs to take away America's phone. The National Guard is getting its own Eras Tour. And Trump is building an entire room just for his balls. So let's get into the headlines. [CHEERING] All right. I'm not going to sugarcoat it. It's been a tough week for America. No matter what side of the aisle you've been on, we have all been processing what happened to Charlie Kirk and what's happened since. Honestly, I don't even know if I have the right words for this. But I do take comfort in knowing that I'm not the only one who can't seem to find the right words. [LAUGHTER] Well, we all grieve in our own way. To be fair to Trump, he is an old man. And when an old man wants to tell a story, it doesn't matter what you asked him about. Yeah. Uncle Marty, you want some coffee? You know, my dentist is an Asian lady. [LAUGHTER] She dyed her hair pink. I told her, you look disgusting. [LAUGHTER] But while the president is retreating into home renovations, the internet has been processing Kirk's death in a different way. If you've been on social media over the past week, you've probably seen some pretty shocking reactions to a public figure getting assassinated. There was celebration. There was mockery. Honestly, I found a lot of it so disturbing, I almost went back to Threads. [LAUGHTER] I mean, I didn't. Nothing could make me go back to Threads. But I did think about it. And as expected, when people are being this shitty on the internet, there's going to be backlash. REPORTER: On social media, people who've criticized Kirk are being called out, their names and photos widely circulated. Some people who celebrated his death are now under scrutiny from conservative activists. Those activists have created online websites to hold accountable those behind the messages. The website claims it's received more than 63,000 submissions so far. REPORTER: Some employers already firing or suspending people for their posts about Kirk, impacting teachers, commercial pilots, doctors, and even NFL staff. Even the NFL staff are getting fired? [LAUGHTER] Oh, that's why the Giants suck. [LAUGHTER] Unfortunately, this is a pattern we've gotten used to. Because we live in an internet landscape that is so toxic, even RFK wouldn't swim in it. So every horrible event tends to have the same cycle. One side starts posting their hot takes for clicks, and the other side tries to cancel them for it. But one thing is different this time. This time, the government's getting involved. Employers, you have an obligation to get rid of people. People say, oh, people have a right to say things. Well, actually, they don't necessarily have a right to say things. I think it is time for this to be a crackdown on people. So when you see someone celebrating Charlie's murder, call them out, and hell, call their employer. [AUDIENCE BOOING] Hold on. The vice president wants me to try to get people fired from their jobs? First off, as a white woman, we've been doing that for years, OK? Stop appropriating our culture. But secondly, is this what we want? The vice president's job isn't to lead an online mob. The vice president's job is to-- OK, he doesn't really have a job. But you get my point. [APPLAUSE] You get it. [CHEERING] And look, a lot of people are saying that this is a left versus right thing. But truly, I think this problem goes so much deeper. Our discourse has been so poisoned by the internet that our elected officials are now using the power and resources of the federal government to carry out social-media-style justice. REPORTER: Secretary Pete Hegseth has directed his staff to look for posts from service members. Secretary of State Marco Rubio floated revoking critical visas. The power of law enforcement under President Trump's leadership will be used to find you, will be used to take away your money, take away your power. REPORTER: Republican Congressman Clay Higgins of Louisiana posted he will use his congressional authority to get people banned for life from social media platforms, blacklist their businesses, and they should be kicked out of school and have their driver's licenses revoked. [LAUGHTER] All right. First of all, revoking someone's driver's license is not a punishment for them. It's a punishment for their friends, OK? I'm not driving Amy to the airport because you got mad at her tweets, Clay Higgins. You drive Amy to the airport. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] But do you see how far this has gotten out of control? We're going to revoke a person's driver's license just for having shitty tweets? And our attorney general is in so deep that she doesn't think it's going far enough. There's free speech, and then there's hate speech. And there is no place, especially now, especially after what happened to Charlie, in our society. We will absolutely target you, go after you if you are targeting anyone with hate speech, anything-- and that's across the aisle. [LAUGHTER] First of all, you would think that the attorney general would know that hate speech is protected by the First Amendment. [CHEERING] Even if you're not a big reader, it is the first one. You have to read it to get to the one you like. Now, honestly, if I went back in time and told the Founding Fathers that this is what would become of the First Amendment, they would say, that's insane. And why are you wearing pants, woman? [LAUGHTER] To which I would say, why are you wearing a wig? [LAUGHTER] Anyway-- [APPLAUSE] --I'm getting off track. I'm getting off track. The point is, we need to understand that no matter how mad someone makes you online, that's not enough to make it illegal. That said, if you are going to crack down on hate speech, can I request that we start with the YouTube comments under my lasagna recipe? [LAUGHTER] My mozzarella portions are not gay. [LAUGHTER] Very good. [APPLAUSE] Now, I was heartened to see a lot of conservatives criticize Pam Bondi for what she said about prosecuting hate speech. Unfortunately, one guy thinks she didn't go far enough. And what do you make of Pam Bondi saying she's going to go after hate speech? Is that-- I mean, a lot of people-- a lot of your allies say hate speech is free speech. Should probably go after people like you because you treat me so unfairly. It's hate. You have a lot of hate in your heart. Yikes. Someone's ballroom construction is not going well. [LAUGHTER] For more on how we can move forward as a country, let's turn now to Michael Kosta. [CHEERING] Wait. Kosta, why are you dressed like that? Dressed like what, Desi? This is just how people look now, totally rad. Quit being such a freakazoid. [LAUGHTER] You look like an undercover cop trying to take down the Breakfast Club Oh. Well, thank you. But look, if you want to fix a society poisoned by social media, the only solution is to return to a time before the internet. So all of us need to pretend that it's the 1980s again-- no Twitter, no algorithms, just the sweet sounds of Duran Duran playing whatever music is they play. Totally tubular. [LAUGHTER] OK, OK. Even if this made any sense, why the '80s? Why not the 1950s or the 1800s? None of those times had social media. Yeah, they did. Psych. They didn't. No, Desi, the 1980s is right. The music is fresh. The fashion is bitchin'. And we're in that sweet spot after the smallpox vaccine but before RFK, Jr. said we couldn't get the smallpox vaccine. You know, he was just a cool heroin addict back now. Cowabunga. Where's the beef? [CHEERING] Come on. This is clearly an overcorrection. That era wasn't all stupid hair and wearing neon. There was still political violence in the '80s. Yeah, yeah, but I didn't know about that, you know? I was just a little kid back then. Do you remember any of that? No, of course not. I was born whenever 29 years ago was. [LAUGHTER] Don't google it. I can't google it. It's the '80s. Plus, the '80s being awesome is one of the only things conservatives and liberals agree on. Liberals have early Madonna, the dawn of hip-hop, thongs on the outside of pants. Conservatives get to run politics, hang out with Mr. T, and hate gay people, even while being secretly gay. We all get something, to the max. [LAUGHTER] Our entire country can't just pretend it's the '80s. Why not? What's your damage? ET phone home, gag me with a credit card and put me on layaway. - OK. Stop. Shut up. Shut the [BLEEP] up, Kosta. We can't solve our issues with mass delusion. We have to address our social media addiction, not to mention our widespread gun use, the collapse of our social bonds, mental health treatment. There is so much that we have to fix if we want to move forward. And you think fixing all of those systemic issues will be easier than just pretending it's 1980? [LAUGHTER] [CHEERING] I'll have what she's having. Yippee-ki-yay, Desi. Michael Kosta, everybody."
pq15ff11nnM,Trump Suddenly Sides with Ukraine & MAGA Spins Conspiracies About U.N. Escalator | The Daily Show,The Daily Show,Political Commentary (Left),20250925,752,2323187,54777,"It's no secret Donald Trump sympathizes with Russia in its war against Ukraine. He blamed Ukraine for getting invaded. He berated its president in the Oval Office. And he made the ultimate gesture of friendship to Vladimir Putin, picking him up at the airport. So safe to assume he spent this week at the UN continuing his full-throated support of Russia. REPORTER: Breaking news we are following this morning-- President Trump reversed his position on the war and voiced confidence that Ukraine can regain its territory seized by Russia. Trump writing in part, ""Ukraine would be able to take back their country in its original form and, who knows, maybe even go further than that."" Damn. [LAUGHTER] Trump went from Ukraine needs to accept Russian invasion they need to invade Russia. [LAUGHTER] When this all began, Trump said he'd end this war on day one. And instead, we've now joined both sides. I guess you can't lose a war if you're on both sides. Now, let's not overreact here. Trump isn't exactly known for his consistent positions. He could just as easily switch sides again tomorrow if he, I don't know, gets complimented by a Russian lady or sees a photo of that dog that looks like Vladimir Putin. [LAUGHTER] Oh, oh, who pushes his opponents out the window? You do. You do. Ooh. But still, it's a surprising development. Maybe Trump changed his position after coming to a better understanding of the geopolitical implications of the situation. Or perhaps it was something a bit more personal. REPORTER: Last month, President Trump rolled out the red carpet for Vladimir Putin in Alaska but is now sharing frustration. I thought that was going to be the easiest one because of my relationship with Putin. But unfortunately, that relationship didn't mean anything. Oh. [LAUGHTER] This season of The Golden Bachelor is [BLEEP] weird. [LAUGHTER] Weird. [APPLAUSE] Hey, you know what? You know what? Don't get down on yourself, Donald. It's not your fault the relationship didn't work out. Who could have known not to trust Russian dictator Vladimir Putin? You're not a mind reader. But whether it was pursuing strategic objectives or merely getting tired of [BLEEP] boys, this was a major development. Unfortunately, it was overshadowed by another international incident. The president was joined by the first lady today as he made his big address at the United Nations. But they had a bit of trouble on the way. They were taking an escalator when it stopped working, leaving the first couple no other choice but to walk the rest of the way up. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] Yeah. I like how he's just looking around when it broke, thinking, do I walk up these 15 stairs or do I just live here now? [LAUGHTER] But hey, this is a pretty standard inconvenience. I'm sure we will never hear about it again, unless, of course, there's an entire rightwing media apparatus built on grievance and hyperbole that wants to breathlessly recount it as a harrowing brush with danger. Trump and Melania were riding it up, and it just stopped. The first lady lost her balance a bit but steadied herself, thankfully, and then marched to the top. She could have been hurt. It came to a grinding halt. And you can even see them kind of slightly lurching forward. This is serious stuff, sitting ducks if, God forbid, there was a security threat. They could have hurt the most beautiful first lady in American history. Oh my god, you monsters. We're not talking about some uggo Eleanor Roosevelt here, no. You could have hurt someone hot. [LAUGHTER] It's a good thing Melania is in such good shape. And it's a good thing Trump's ankles are the size of car tires. [LAUGHTER] You all laughed at his cankles. But guess who's sturdy as a redwood? This cankle-having mother-[BLEEP]. [LAUGHTER] Now, the UN released a statement saying somebody at the top of the escalator inadvertently triggered a safety mechanism. So it seems like the whole thing is just a silly coincidence. Coincidence or sabotage? It doesn't look like a coincidence to me. Something more nefarious happening than just simple technical glitches. Absolute sabotage. I've been caught on, like, five elevators in my life. An escalator has never stopped working mid escalation. I find it bizarre that just coincidentally, all these things just don't happen to work for the president when they work for everybody else. Are we really doing this? [LAUGHTER] Are we going all in on the president being a victim of escalator sabotage? Because the deep state wants him to get his steps in? Can we just have a day, people? I will admit, it's a little suspicious that the escalator just happened to break for Trump. But on the other hand, things do break a lot around him. You know, I pay all this money to teleprompter people. And I'd say 20% of the time, they don't work. They don't work. And I apologize for those lights. The only place I don't have a light's up here. I feel like I'm in a sauna. So I don't know what hotel this is, but you ought to try turning on the air conditioning. I think this mic stinks, by the way. So maybe it's not a coincidence. I mean, why does everything around Trump break? Is he-- is he being followed around by gremlins? Is that-- OK, yeah, maybe. Maybe that's actually-- that-- that could be. That-- [APPLAUSE] That might be it. That might be it. So conservative media is furious that Trump was attacked by a stopped escalator. And apparently, some of them were furious that his people did nothing about it. REPORTER: But that's a major security failure. And I was more, you know, stunned at the reaction. Like, the leader of the free world is on the escalator. And Secret Service is looking, like, what do we do? Yeah. What do we do? Do we just let this grown man walk up stairs? [LAUGHTER] What do you want Secret Service to do? Wouldn't it have been more embarrassing if they had rushed in and made a big deal out of it, thrown Trump over their shoulder like a kid having a meltdown leaving the Magic Kingdom? [LAUGHTER] But look, there's no point trying to reason with them now. The rightwing train is leaving the station. So naturally, the White House is jumping on board. Well, there was some concerning reporting over the weekend from the London Times, as you pointed out, that UN globalist staffers were basically plotting to set up the President of the United States. And if we find that these were UN staffers who were purposefully trying to trip up-- literally trip up-- the president and the first lady of the United States, well, there better be accountability for those people. And I will personally see to it, Jesse. Good. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] Can you people please decide if Trump is the strongest man who has ever walked the Earth or a sickly child with hollow bird bones who will crumble if he walks up three stairs? [LAUGHTER] Now, remember, the UN already gave an official explanation about why the escalator stopped. But see if you think the president's TV friends are buying it. The spokesperson for the UN General Secretary said this. ""As the videographer who was""-- I don't buy this, by the way-- ""was traveling backwards up the escalator reached the top, the first lady, followed by the President Trump, each mounted the steps at the bottom. At that moment""-- it was 9:50 AM if you're counting at home-- ""the escalator came to a stop."" Dot, dot, dot. Dot, dot, dot. [LAUGHTER] We're making ellipses feel sinister now? What are these dots? What are they hiding? And don't get me started on semicolons. Are you a period or a comma? Pick one! But also, why does Brian Kilmeade think he knows better than the UN officials? What makes him an expert on escalators? It's never happened to me before. I do a lot of shopping, go to a lot of malls, go to the second floor where the men's stuff is. No. I go right to the men's floor. I don't stop at the kids' floor. No, no, no, I shop in the-- I shop in the men's section, even though sometimes a kid's double XL is basically a men's small and the designs are cooler. But that's totally not where I shop. [LAUGHTER] Sometimes I sneak into the Spencer Gifts when my mom's not looking. Look, you know what? I'm sorry, I interrupted you, Brian Kilmeade. I'm sure this story is going somewhere. Go to the second floor with a men's stuff is, you know, because you walk in on the first Floor-- never happened to me. Uh, that's great. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] That's it? Your whole story about the escalator is that you also once went up an escalator? Another fascinating addition to the discourse. And if I may also add, I too have been on an escalator. Uh, that's great. [LAUGHTER] For more on escalator-gate and the controversy around it, we turn to Grace Kuhlenschmidt. Grace. [CHEERING] Grace, wait a minute. Why are you in a parking garage? Because I'm investigating, Jordan. I've been talking to my sources. And let me tell you, this escalator story goes all the way to the top and then flattens out and goes back down to the bottom. Wait. Are you saying the Fox News people are right, that there's more to this story? You better believe it, bitch. [LAUGHTER] The deep state has all sorts of plans for Donald Trump. I'm talking somebody getting on his elevator, then pushing all the buttons and then jumping out. I'm talking about those car door locks that keep unlocking just as he tries to pull it open. So he tries it again just as they unlock it again. And he's like, god damn it, just let me unlock it. I'm talking removing the latch on the bathroom stall so he's got to do that little football squat thing where he holds the door while pinching a loaf. OK. [LAUGHTER] But what's the point? It seems kind of silly. Silly. [LAUGHS] Really, Jordan? You think it's silly that Donald Trump almost fell down a flight of stairs at the UN? Our beloved president toppling backwards, his legs flying over his head, hitting every step going down-- doy, doy, doy, doy. Is that funny? [LAUGHTER] Landing on his butt, his pants splitting wide open in front of every world leader while the king of England says, (IN BRITISH ACCENT) good heavens, I saw a testicle. (IN REGULAR ACCENT) Would that be funny to you? I mean, yes, it would. It would be funny, yes. Frankly, Grace, frankly, I just doubt that there is some global prank conspiracy. Oh. So I guess I just woke up this morning with my hand in a bowl of warm water for no reason? No. It's because they know I'm getting close. Grace, look, it doesn't need this big investigation. It's just an escalator malfunction. Oh, is that right? Jordan, let me tell you a story. When I was 12 years old, all I wanted most in the world was a dress for my middle school dance. So I went to the mall, and I took an escalator to the second floor. Because that's where the teen stuff is. Because you walk in on the first floor. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] Is that the whole story? Yeah, I was on an escalator once. Uh, yeah. That's great. Grace Kuhlenschmidt, everyone."
RTf2MdntsF0,Trump Blames Autism on Tylenol While Americans Prep for the Rapture on TikTok | The Daily Show,The Daily Show,Political Commentary (Left),20250924,725,2279095,56904,"Welcome to The Daily Show. I'm Jordan Klepper. We got so much to talk about tonight. The United Nations is a total dump. None of us are going to heaven. And the big question-- are you putting too much liquid into your baby? Let's get into headlines. [CHEERING] We are living in crazy times right now. People are feeling worried and depressed. However, there is some good news. The world is ending. REPORTER: The end is near. At least, that's what one corner of TikTok is claiming. My fellow Christians out there, I want this video to help one another. REPORTER: It's being called RaptureTok, a convinced contingent of TikTok users who claim the rapture is happening today, some even claiming to be selling all their possessions. One man says he got rid of his car. I'm catching a flight to heaven in September anyway. I won't need the car. [LAUGHTER] You're going to heaven without a car? Good luck getting laid up there, buddy. [LAUGHTER] Listen, if I believed my earthly body was going to leave this worldly realm, my first reaction would not be to turn a profit on Carvana. Come September, I will stand naked before my creator. Are you interested in a 2017 Kia Sorento? By the way, I just want to say how unfair the TikTok algorithm is. It's giving some people a heads up about the end of the world? Mine is just all videos of guys power washing sidewalks. [LAUGHTER] And while some people may or may not depart this mortal coil, for those of us left behind, there is a lot of shit we have to deal with-- chief among those, our president. Yesterday, Donald Trump held a major press conference to announce the cause of autism and also announce that RFK, Jr. is officially a weirder color than him now. [LAUGHTER] Now-- [LAUGHTER] It's just not natural. Now, we've known for a while that this administration has wanted to blame autism on vaccines. But yesterday's big announcement came with a plot twist. First, effective immediately, the FDA will be notifying physicians that the use of ""acita""-- well, let's see how we say that. ""Acita"" ""meniphen."" Acetaminophen. [LAUGHTER] Is that OK? Which is basically commonly known as Tylenol. Tylenol-- at least you finished strong. Now, I don't want to suggest there's been some disconcerting cognitive decline. But back in 2020, that mofo could spit out hydroxychloroquine, no problem. [LAUGHTER] So everyone was waiting for Trump to blame autism on vaccines. But he zagged and blamed Tylenol, which is especially strange because nearly all health officials say there's no causal link between acetaminophen and autism. However, Trump has his own recommendation. Tylenol during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism. So taking Tylenol is, uh, not good. Don't take Tylenol. Don't have your baby take Tylenol. Don't take Tylenol. There's no downside. Don't take it. Don't take Tylenol. But with Tylenol, don't take it. Nothing bad can happen. It can only good happen. [LAUGHTER] Ask your doctor if it could only good happen for you. Trump is so pissed at Tylenol, he's going to start bombing the pain reliever aisles at Walgreens. Joke's on you, Trump. Even missiles can't get through that plexiglass. [LAUGHTER] You're going to have to ring the customer service button like the rest of us. You can tell Trump doesn't understand what a woman goes through during pregnancy. But as a dad who didn't miss a single appointment, it's not true that only good can happen if you don't take Tylenol. Not treating a pregnant woman's fever could cause irreparable harm before the baby comes out of her butt. [LAUGHTER] Read a parenting book, Trump. And Trump wasn't just playing fast and loose with acetaminophen. He made sure to throw some anti-vax classics in there too. And by the way, I think I can say that there are certain groups of people that don't take vaccines and don't take any pills that have no autism, that have no autism. Does that tell you something? That's currently-- is that a correct statement, by the way? [LAUGHTER] No, but you-- you had fun out there, and that's all that matters. [LAUGHTER] You know, for the future, typically, a president should check something before announcing it to the nation. I mean, this is literally how they fact check on The Joe Rogan Experience. Yeah. If you have sex in space, your dick will actually explode because of gravity stuff. Is that a correct statement? So as we wait for the fact check, let's hear some of the data you've collected. You have certain groups-- the Amish, as an example. They have essentially no autism. It doesn't exist with the Amish community. And they don't take all of this junk. It doesn't exist. Are the Amish the best control group for this? [LAUGHTER] So based on the Amish, the cure for autism could either be not taking Tylenol or being scared of a Roomba. Now, Trump didn't flat-out say that kids shouldn't get vaccinated. But he did argue that the shot should be spread out rather than combined. And he had a very unusual explanation for why. There's too much liquid. Too many different things are going into that baby at too big a-- too big a number. You have a little child, a little fragile child. And you get a vat of 80 different vaccines, I guess. And they pump so much stuff into those beautiful little babies. They're pumping-- it looks like they're pumping into a horse. [LAUGHTER] I'm sorry. They're pumping vats of liquid into the babies like horses? Are you sure you were at the pediatrician's office and not the Kentucky Derby? It's for babies. They inject them, hammer shoes on their feet. A little man rides them around in a circle. It's inhumane. Look. To me, doesn't sound like Donald Trump knows what he's talking about. Presumably, he has done enough research on vaccines to be an expert at this point. The MMR, I think, should be taken separately. The mumps, measles, and-- and-- the three should be taken separately. Yes, the MMR vaccine-- Mumps, Measles-- I want to say Ringo, probably? [LAUGHTER] Forget about taking them together, Trump can't even say them together. The whole point of this press conference was to finally give answers to families that have been desperate for decades. So for everyone's sake, will you please give us some assurance that these bold claims are built on concrete evidence? This is based on what I feel. Damn it. You know what? I never thought I'd say this, but maybe we should all do our own research. For more on Trump's autism presser and the Tylenol fallout, we go live to the White House and Michael Kosta. [CHEERING] Michael. Michael, what's the latest? To be honest, I haven't done any research because I sort of thought I'd be raptured by now. Come on, Michael. You don't even go to church. Well, church is for losers. But I-- I'm a cool guy. And God doesn't just want to hang around with virgins and priests, you know? He needs somebody to throw back some suds and toss the old pigskin around with-- cool guy stuff. That's me, Mikey K. - OK. All right. So can you tell us anything about how Tylenol is reacting to all of this? Well, I'd imagine this is causing quite the headache for them, which sucks because they can't even take Tylenol for it. Or they can, but they risk their child being excellent at Jeopardy! [LAUGHTER] All right. Well, Michael-- wait, what do you think the-- wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait, Michael. Michael, what's happening? I can-- I can see through you. Oh, shit. It's happening. I'm getting raptured. [CHEERING] Jordan, Jordan, it feels amazing. It's like pooping, but I'm the one getting pooped. No, no. You can't be getting raptured, Kosta. You're not rapture-worthy. Well, I guess God disagrees. Enjoy the Apocalypse, bitch. [CHEERING] Oh, shit. OJ, what are you doing up here? No. I can't believe that. This is such bullshit. All right. Whatever. You know what? I don't even care. I don't even care. Let's go to the CDC. I guess I'll-- I'll talk with Desi Lydic. Yes, Desi. [CHEERING] So Desi, Kosta got raptured. So I guess I'll ask you about Tylenol. Who the hell cares about Tylenol? Kosta got raptured? How did Kosta get raptured and not me? I know, right? We're way better than him. Yeah. Jordan, he sends me porn at work. And it's not even good porn. I know. Did he send you the one with the girl and the-- - And the golden retriever? - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And now he's in heaven? You know what? Screw it. If that's who gets raptured, I'd rather just stay right here with you. Thank you, Desi. I feel the same way. We can make our own heaven right here. Yes, yes. That's exactly right. We are in this together, you and me. Trust me when I say, I will never leave your-- oh, thank God. Oh my god, it's happening. I thought I was going to have to spend eternity with Jordan Klepper. No, wait. What? What? No, what happened-- what happened to we're in this together? Yeah, that's before I knew I was better than you. Enjoy the Apocalypse, bitch. [CHEERING] OJ, what are you doing up here? Damn it, those bastards. Is there-- is there anyone-- is there anyone left? You know what? OK. I guess we can go to Tylenol's corporate headquarters if Josh Johnson is still there. Josh? Josh, are you there? [CHEERING] It's crazy. Can you believe Kosta was rapture-worthy? Yeah, I can see it. He was always really nice to me. He sent me porn at work. Oh. Look, it's-- it's just you and me now, Josh. Just please stick with me. I just want one friend, you know? Oh, no. Are you kidding me? You're disappearing? What, are you getting raptured too? Oh, this? No, I'm not getting raptured. This is because my mom took Tylenol when she was pregnant with me. [LAUGHTER] Jordan, it's true what they say. If you don't take it, it can only good happen. Damn it. Josh Johnson, Desi Lydic, Michael Kosta, OJ Simpson-- I think."
SoZwKjQ0c18,Shutdown Sparks Cringey Meme War & Trump Punishes Blue Cities | The Daily Show,,Political Commentary (Left),20251003,680,2209421,51844,"It's day two of the shutdown, and only the most essential services are still operating-- Social Security, Medicare, and that department that makes up causes for autism. [LAUGHTER] Today, it's minestrone. [LAUGHTER] You hear that? Don't give pregnant women minestrone. It's got too many different things in it that the body can't handle. Now, for the Republicans and Democrats, the most important part of the shutdown is coming together and blaming the other side for it. President Trump has been posting AI videos of Hakeem Jeffries in a sombrero. And now, unfortunately, Democrats are hitting back with their own videos. Can you see me? Well, of course, you can't, because the Republicans turned the lights off. [LAUGHTER] No Republicans here because they all died from secondhand embarrassment. [LAUGHTER] Look, Democrats aren't as good as at video content as they are at sending emails asking for money. So I don't know. Let's try something else. REPORTER: Yesterday, Democrats posted a kitty explains meme blaming the GOP for the shutdown. [LAUGHTER] Wow, that was also not good, but still better than whatever Batman villain Chuck Schumer is turning into. I mean, my guess is the Penguin. But you know what? They made a substantive point in there. I'd like to see Republicans' counterargument. REPORTER: Republicans, of course, responded with this, a kitten wearing a sombrero. God damn, the sombrero meme is undefeated. It's like an unblockable combo. With this meme, Republicans will never have to make a coherent point again. It's unstoppable. Republican Senator Ted Cruz added his own version of hey, Macarena, superimposing the image on 44 Democratic senators. And it's over. Once Ted Cruz joins in on something, it's dead. Actually, you know what? Can we also get him a Labubu? Because I'm kind of sick of those things. Now, you might be wondering why Republicans keep putting sombreros on Democrats. Apparently, it's part of their talking point that Democrats shut down the government to help illegal immigrants. What they have done instead is to shut down the government because we won't give billions of dollars to healthcare funding for illegal aliens. They prioritized taxpayer-funded benefits for illegal aliens over keeping the government open for American citizens. ANNOUNCER: Democrats, the party of open borders, transgender for everybody, lawlessness in our streets, are shutting down the government in an effort to appease the radical left. These Democrats are demanding nearly $1.5 trillion in spending for an agenda that includes health care for illegal aliens and much, much more. Holy shit. [LAUGHTER] When you wake up from surgery, you will be a transgender illegal immigrant. [LAUGHTER] I mean, that ad was so scary, I was expecting the girl from The Ring to crawl out of it and then become the boy from The Ring. [LAUGHTER] But this is a pretty big accusation, OK? Democrats say they are shutting down the government because they want to preserve health care for tens of millions of Americans. But Republicans say Democrats just want to give health care to illegal immigrants. So can someone just clear this up for me? REPORTER: Republicans pressuring moderate Democrats by claiming they are pushing for health care for undocumented immigrants. But their accusation is dubious and refers to a small group of benefit recipients whose status is considered lawfully present. Federal law explicitly prohibits undocumented people from receiving aid. So, in other words, some of the health care that Democrats are trying to get for Americans might also trickle down to some people who are not Americans. You know when you're showering and you aren't trying to wash your feet, but it just kind of, sort of happens by accident along the way, which I actually just learned is how white people wash their feet? [LAUGHTER] They don't-- they don't make a point-- they don't lift up their feet and wash it. They just-- if it happens, it happens. Anyway, that's what this shutdown is about now. Now, look, this isn't the first time the party shut down the government and blamed each other, OK? But this time, Republicans aren't just trying to blame Democrats. They're trying to punish the states they come from. REPORTER: The White House has already started targeting projects important to Democrats, blocking $8 billion for energy projects in 16 states that voted Democrat in the last presidential election. REPORTER: The Trump administration announced Wednesday it would withhold $18 billion in funding for transportation projects in New York City, home to Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries. Wait a minute right there. You're telling me every New Yorker is going to suffer because of your beef with Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries? Hey, President Trump. Don't forget, there are things in New York you care about too. All right? Like Wall Street, Fox News hosts, your current wife and the home she lives in by herself for some reason. Right? [LAUGHTER] But you know what, Trump? New York doesn't want your money anyway, OK? Our transportation is just fine. Our rats are getting so big, you can ride them to work now. [LAUGHTER] And by the way, it's not just Democratic states. This dude is going scorched earth on his own government. REPORTER: White House Budget director Russ Vought warned mass layoffs could come within the next two days. President Trump is teasing that I have a meeting with Russ Vought, he of Project 2025 fame, to determine which of the many Democrat agencies, most of which are a political scam, he recommends to be cut. A lot of good can come down from shutdowns. We can get rid of a lot of things that we didn't want. And they'd be Democrat things. That's right. This guy is excited for the shutdown. And that's the Democrats' fatal mistake. They assume that Donald Trump cares about the government he's the president of. You think you're playing a game of chicken, but he's playing a game of let me crash into your car. [LAUGHTER] And as you heard, the guy who's driving his car is the White House budget director and future Paul Giamatti Oscar role, Russell Vought. According to Senator Mike Lee, this guy might be even more excited about tearing down the government than Donald Trump. Russ Vought, the OMB director, has been dreaming about this moment, preparing for this moment since puberty. [LAUGHTER] Look, I know puberty can get weird, but-- [LAUGHTER] --this guy's balls dropped, and he was like, oh, man, I want to fire people in the government so bad, especially Democrats. [APPLAUSE] This-- this is probably the only 13-year-old in history who hid a copy of the federal budget inside a Penthouse. [LAUGHTER] I mean, I hope Democrats have a plan for this. Because letting this guy have control of the federal government-- I can't think of anything scarier than-- oh, shit. Oh, [BLEEP]. Oh my god. Sorry, I stand corrected here. For more on the Republican shutdown strategy, let's go live to DC with Michael Kosta. [CHEERING] Michael. Michael, it seems like Republicans are really enjoying this shutdown. They sure are, Ronny. I'm outside Russell Vought's bathroom. Once he's-- once he's done jerking it in there, they're going to get to work slashing the government. [LAUGHTER] Gross. He's jerking off at work? He's excited, man. He's been dreaming about this moment since puberty. Although, it has been an hour. Hey, Russ, take it easy in there, bud. Slow and steady wins the race. OK. Well, I guess I don't understand why the Republicans are so strict about any money going to illegal immigrants. Like, isn't that worth it if it helps give Americans health care? Absolutely not, Ronny. That is not the American way. Obviously, we'd all love medical treatments for our diseases. But is that worth risking an illegal immigrant getting free aspirin? No way, Jose. [SPANISH] mi amor. Biblioteca. RONNY CHIENG: OK. [LAUGHTER] OK. Listen, Michael. Me personally, I think I would prefer the medical treatment for all. God, you just don't get it, Ronny. So let me give it to you straighter than my boy Russell's giving it to his left palm in there. Here you go, big Russ. America is built on two principles-- one, liquor before beer, you're in the clear, which is not really relevant here. But two, we'd rather everybody get nothing than one illegal get anything, whether it's health care or air traffic control. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on. Hang on. What, and air traffic control? Yeah. Americans don't want our taxpayer dollars going to safely land a plane that illegal immigrants are on. [LAUGHTER] But what if Americans are also on that plane? Well, then it would be an honor to go down in a blaze of taxpayer savings watching Jumanji 2. And speaking of balls of fire-- hey, Russell, finish it up there, man. If you pull that thing off, they'll make you switch bathrooms. RONNY CHIENG: All right. [LAUGHTER] Kosta, this is so stupid. Oh, it's stupid? Was it stupid to homeschool myself so I didn't risk being educated alongside some legal asylum seeker? No, because me a proud citizen of the UFA. [LAUGHTER] I think it's the USA. It can be either. The bottom line is, yeah, maybe in America, you go bankrupt over medical costs, but at least everyone else does too. And if you don't like that, you should have thought of that before your appendix burst. And speaking of bursting, I better go. I need to get Russell a copy of the federal budget to help him finish the job. Russ, I'm actually worried now. RONNY CHIENG: Michael Kosta, everyone."
5zQ0WewZY50,Trump & Tariffs: Last Week Tonight with John Oliver (HBO),LastWeekTonight,Political Commentary (Left),20250414,1625,14887561,200399,"♪ (""LAST WEEK TONIGHT"" THEME PLAYS) ♪ We're going to dive straight in with our main story this week, which concerns the ongoing chaos of Trump's tariffs. It's been an emotional roller coaster since Trump rolled them out last week with the help of the single dumbest chart in human history. That prompted the Dow to drop by nearly 4,000 points in two days. So, by Monday, everyone was understandably freaking out, only for Trump to dismiss anyone concerned as ""panicans,"" which he said was a, quote, ""new party based on weak and stupid people."" Though I'd argue the weak and stupid demo is, if anything, way overrepresented in government right now. Then on Tuesday, Trump gave a speech to Republican donors where he floated major new tariffs on pharmaceuticals, told the audience, ""I know what the hell I'm doing,"" and claimed this. I'm telling you, these countries are calling us up, kissing my ass. They are-- They are dying to make a deal. ""Please, please, sir, make a deal. I'll do anything."" Yeah, I'm sure some have been pretty nice to him, the same way that you'd try to be nice if you suddenly found yourself in the same room -as a monkey with a gun. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ""Hi, monkey. Good monkey. Strong monkey. Please, I'll do anything."" By Wednesday morning, though, Trump's reassurances were getting more desperate as he, at one point, posted, ""Be cool! Everything is going to work out well."" A sentence that's never been true in human history. That is the phrase you hear before someone skateboards off a roof, shows you their homemade water slide, or asks you to hold the camera while they climb into the alligator exhibit to ""do something hilarious."" Just a few hours later, Trump announced a 90-day pause on most of his biggest tariffs, and he did it so abruptly, it caught some key members of his own administration by surprise. ED O'KEEFE: A sudden change in policy came as Democrats grilled his top trade representative on Capitol Hill. STEVEN HORSFORD: It looks like your boss just pulled the rug out from under you and paused the tariffs, the taxes on the American people. There's no strategy. You just found out three seconds ago, sitting here. We saw you. That's true. That's true. That congressman later tweeted out this photo showing what it looked like to watch that guy get the news. And how do you think he found out? A push notification? A work email? Or 32 concurrent messages on the office group text where one guy goes, ""What the fuck, what the fuck, what the fuck,"" and another goes, ""Hoooollyyy shit."" Another's like, ""LOL, J fucking K, I guess."" And the guy who's always asked dumb questions is like, ""Wait, what's happening?"" And then the first guy sends the link to the Times article, and the dumb one's like, ""Oh my God, what the hell! Did this just happen?"" And then everyone at the same time texts, ""Yes, Cody."" (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) This week was total chaos. At one point, the daily trading range of the S&P 500 was more than five percent for six straight days. The previous times that happened were in March 2020, during COVID, late 2008, during the housing crisis, and October 1987, which, if you are too young to remember, was a stock market crash so massive, Nightline felt like it needed to do this to explain it to people. Here once again to help us, my good friend, Kermit. Thank you, Ted. Can you tell us what is a bear market? Yes, Ted. Well, thank you. Being a bear myself, that is one of the first things we bears are taught in the caves. If I recall, a bear market is where prices are going down for a long period of time. So one would wish, I suppose, for a bull market to drive the bears out. No, no, we don't want that. We never want that. (COMMOTION) (MOOS) Yeah, they explained a complicated financial crash with Muppets, a sentence so ""this show"" coded, I'm genuinely surprised that we didn't think of it. Honestly, if Ted Koppel had a British accent, glasses, way less gravitas, and occasionally referred to Kermit as ""a bona fide swamp snack,"" I couldn't tell the difference there. And the thing is, the turmoil isn't over, because what Trump's left in place, including a baseline ten percent tariff on all imports and a 145 percent tariff on China, is still a monumental shift in US trade policy. And despite what some in the White House claim, that the 90-day pause was part of the strategy all along, Trump himself seemed to admit that he did it in reaction to the market's panicking. I thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line. They were getting yippy, you know? They were getting a little bit yippy, a little bit afraid. Hold on. ""A little bit afraid"" is a massive understatement. People were freaking out about their 401(k)s. There were grandmas looking at their retirement plan and getting ready to open an OnlyFans to get through the next five years. And it wasn't just ordinary investors. One financial analyst wrote, after talking to fund managers, ""A few have quietly wondered if the president might be insane."" Which is fair, everyone knows the right time to ask if someone might be insane is five months after you elect them president. Look, this week was incredibly stupid, but it's important to understand exactly how stupid it was because we're not out of the woods yet. And the damage the president's already done to confidence in our economic system could have lasting repercussions. So tonight, let's talk about Trump and his tariffs. Let's start with the fact that none of this should have been a surprise. Not only did Trump bring up the idea of ten percent universal tariffs repeatedly on the campaign trail, he's been obsessed with the idea of punishing other countries with tariffs for years now. In fact, when he touched off a trade war with China in his first term, we spent 21 minutes unpacking it, and the arguments hold up pretty well, although I clearly do not, as evidenced by a YouTube comment from this week, which said, ""I thought this was a new episode until I noticed John's hair was darker and face looked younger,"" which is both hurtful and fair. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) But that piece featured this clip of Trump back in 2011, laying out his whole fantasy of how tariffs could work. Somebody said, ""Well, what would you do? What can you do?"" So easy. I drop a 25 percent tax on China. And, you know, I said to somebody that it's really the messenger. The messenger is important. I could have one man say, ""We're going to tax you 25 percent."" And I could say another, ""Listen, you motherfuckers, we're going to tax you 25 percent."" Okay, putting aside how striking it is to hear the word ""motherfucker"" on C-SPAN... (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...I kind of wish he'd just kept doing the voices there. You can have one guy say, ""Listen, motherfuckers, we're going to tax you 25 percent."" And you can have an Australian guy say, ""Oi, you bloody dingo, we're going to tax you 25 percent, mate."" Or you can have Björk say, ""I will tax you 25 butterfly rainbow sneezes in happiness soup."" There's all sorts of ways that you can do it, but the tariff is the important part. The point is, Trump has long believed that tariffs can fix our trade problems, and that's coupled with his insistence that trade is zero-sum, that if we buy more from another country than we are selling to them, we're somehow getting ripped off. But that is just not how it works, because we are getting things in return. As one Nobel-winning economist jokingly said, ""I run a chronic trade deficit with my barber. He never buys a damn thing from me."" Which is just a classic economist zinger. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Nevertheless, Trump applied both those beliefs to his initial tariff plan, imposing massive penalties on countries, indexed to the size of our trade imbalance, which led to some of the incredibly stupid calculations on Trump's chart, perhaps the dumbest of which was actually explained pretty well by Jim Cramer. Let's go to the Southern African nation of Lesotho, which had the misfortune of being one of the two most highly tariffed nations on Trump's list. They're being hit with a 50 percent duty on their exports to America. That happened because Lesotho only imported 2.8 million dollars’ worth of US goods last year, whereas we imported roughly 240 million worth of stuff from them. Now, the thing is, Lesotho's a really tiny country. Virtually everything we buy from them is either apparel or diamonds. But because it's a very poor country, they can't afford to buy much from us. So, what happens now? To start, we're going to have to pay a lot more for any apparel or diamonds from Lesotho. Maybe we can replace the apparel, but diamonds? I mean, that's a lot harder. And the only way for Lesotho to get out of this jam is by importing more stuff from America, which it can't do because it doesn't have any money. So the president has likely just made things more expensive for Americans and not really changed the behavior of our trading partners. He's right. Shit. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Jim Cramer was right. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) I think I'm going insane. And quick side note there, if you're thinking, ""Hold on, did he say Lesotho's sitting on top of a load of diamonds, but they still don't have any money?"" I know, but we don't have time. That's a different story that I'm sure we'll do one day. I'll put a Post-it note on my computer and everything. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And while Trump's temporarily paused those huge tariffs on Lesotho and others, it is worth asking, what exactly is his endgame here? And it depends on who you ask. When the tariffs first came down, some in the White House insisted they'd be permanent trade barriers intended to raise revenue and bring jobs back home, while others claimed they were a scare tactic designed to help us negotiate more favorable deals. But those are two very different goals, with different consequences for businesses and workers who badly need to know which to plan for. So, let's take each scenario in turn, and let's start with the idea that these tariffs are designed to shut out foreign competition and ensure stuff gets made here. There are a few issues with that, starting with the fact that lots of things aren't produced in the US, sometimes because they simply can't be at any kind of commercial scale. Even Trump's Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick, pictured here rocking a cunty little bob... (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...seemed to understand that last month when he said this. Certain products... If I put a tariff on a mango... Right? We can't grow mangoes in America. We just can't grow a mango. If you put a tariff on a mango, the mango would be more expensive. So then that's just like another version of income tax. How do you think about-- Okay, so the idea is to not do that. Right. The problem is, when the tariffs were announced, mangoes weren't exempted, so we did do that. And sometimes it feels like the best way to ensure Trump does something is to tell him not to do it. He's like a toddler, both because his brain is unable to grasp negations and also because he has a short torso, huge head, always looks like he's about to fall over, and won't let anyone brush his hair. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) That same logic applies to other crops like coffee and bananas, but that is not all, because it's also not easy to make electronics here. Take the Nintendo Switch 2. The company paused pre-orders for it this week, because they didn't know how it'd be affected, as this analyst explained. They gotta figure out what they're gonna get charged. Do they charge 50 percent more? Do they charge double? Do they even ship 'em? How much of this is made in the US? -None of it? -None of it. That is a good point, but an even better delivery of it. I want that guy on hand to respond to all other situations. How much birthday cake is left in the break room? -""None of it."" -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) How much of the Severance goat plot did you actually understand? -""None of it."" -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) How much of Trump's trade briefing did he genuinely read? -""None of it."" -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And if you're thinking, ""Well, hold on, why don't we just build a Switch factory here?"" When it comes to high-tech goods, key components have to be sourced from complex global supply chains. So, it's not a matter of simply building a factory. There is a lot more to it. How much would it cost them to start manufacturing Switches here in the US? Tens of billions of dollars. Billions? That's because of a supply chain that's been built over decades. It would take four to five years to even build and get done a factory here in the US. And the reality is the assembly, the supply chain is in Asia. If you just build a factory here in the US, where are you getting all the parts from? Still in Asia. Exactly. And some of those components are presumably about to be subjected to heavy tariffs. And quick side note, among the many things that I'm mad about right now is the fact that I have to spend time talking about how tariffs will impact the Switch instead of what I really want to talk about, which is that I only just learned the president of Nintendo in America is named Bowser. -That man... -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...I don't shit you even a tiny bit, is called Doug Bowser. Now, if you don't know, Bowser is quite famously the primary antagonist of Mario, the face of Nintendo. Now, in the comedy world, the president of Nintendo being named Doug Bowser is like someone gently setting a ball on a tee, handing you a bat, and saying, ""Please, have fun and swing away."" But unfortunately, because this guy doesn't understand economics, I have to look at real Nintendo President Doug Bowser and say, ""Sorry, everyone, no time for that. -We've got math to do."" -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) It's a truly sad state of affairs, or to put it another way... (MARIO BROS SOUND EFFECT) MARIO: Oh, no! -Exactly. -(AUDIENCE APPLAUDS) The point is, if these tariffs stand, they could have the opposite of the intended purpose, as some business owners might realize it's now cheaper to have a factory outside the US and not have to deal with tariffs. But let's say that despite all of that, we still want all those manufacturing jobs that we lost to come back home. First, as we've discussed before, a lot of them simply don't exist anymore because they've been automated. And second, even if we wanted to build brand-new factories, it's worth knowing these new tariffs mean higher material and equipment costs for manufacturers wanting to do that. And in fact, tariff-swollen building costs have already helped to kill a 300-million-dollar plastics recycling plant in Erie, Pennsylvania, which is a real shame for multiple reasons, including that it would've helped make Erie, Pennsylvania known for something other than the town that boiled a Revolutionary War general's corpse in order to separate his flesh from his bones so they could ship him back to his hometown. The idea-- The idea there being they'd reassemble the skeleton once he was in his final gravesite, but you guessed it, some bones wound up falling out of the wagon on the trek, as bones are wont to do. It's an incredible story, and thanks to the foiled recycling plant, remains the only thing I will ever know about Erie, Pennsylvania. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And even if we do end up bringing some manufacturing jobs home, you also have to factor in that other countries will put tariffs on our goods in return, which will hurt other industries. The current massive tariffs on China are incredibly worrisome for people like this soybean farmer in Tennessee. That trade relationship with China was built over decades and decades. REPORTER: Will Hutchinson, a fourth-generation Tennessee farmer, says he is very concerned. This is going to have an immediate and drastic impact to our ability to compete on the global marketplace for our goods that we produce here in this country. Yeah, that literal soy boy is right. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) This is pointless. If I wanted to watch long-standing relationships destroyed in an instant, I'd just go to a basketball game to see which couples act weird when they end up on the Jumbotron. You can enjoy relationships falling apart without jeopardizing the global economy. And at this point, I'm sure some Trump supporters are saying, ""Well, these were never intended to be permanent. It's that second possibility that you mentioned earlier that the tariffs were always just a way to give Trump leverage to renegotiate bad trade deals. And after he announced that 90-day pause, that was definitely the message getting sold. This is the art of the deal. This shows how strong our president is. A huge win for the president, a huge win for the country, his biggest accomplishment of the second term. Trump won. He's doing exactly what he said he would do. He's a genius in negotiating. He is very calculating in how he negotiates. He understands the art of the deal better than anyone, and he's gotten results in a very short period of time. I don't know what's more desperate there, the shameless sucking up or the need to put the words “We Told You Not to Freak” at the bottom of the screen, which is funny coming from Fox News of all places, considering most of their broadcasts feature messages like, “Why You Should Absolutely Freak About the Green M&M!” (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) But let's at least consider the possibility this was all about gaining leverage for negotiating new deals. That was definitely the White House's spin after the pause was announced, with Trump's Treasury Secretary claiming it had happened because the tariffs brought more than 75 countries forward to negotiate. But a couple of things about that. First, the White House said it will not be releasing a list of the countries that had allegedly done that. So, you know. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And remember, Trump's openly admitted the key reason for his climbdown was ""people got the yippies."" (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And remember, even with the pause, we still have ten percent tariffs on nearly every country in the world, which is still massively disruptive, both to them and to us. And that includes countries like Singapore, where we're going to struggle to get a much better deal, given that we face no tariffs there and actually have a trade surplus. And I'm not saying there aren't countries where we have legitimate trade disputes. Because there are, most notably China, where there are major issues, from their heavy subsidies for homegrown industries to their theft of US companies' intellectual property. Resolving those issues is difficult. It requires diplomacy and a coordinated strategy with our allies. But instead, we've alienated those allies and are going into any future negotiation having provoked China into putting massive tariffs on our goods, too. But don't worry because Trump's charismatic Treasury secretary doesn't seem to think they're gonna be able to hurt us at all. It was a big mistake, this Chinese escalation, because, you know, they're playing with a pair of twos. We are the deficit country. So, what do we lose by the Chinese raising tariffs on us? They-- We-- We export one-fifth to them of what they export to us. So, that-- that is a losing hand for them. Okay, setting aside that ""playing with a pair of twos"" sounds like how you describe a threesome with Don Jr. and Eric... (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...that is incredibly simplistic because it ignores that China's leverage in a negotiation isn't confined to just tariffs. It can hurt us in other ways too, including by cutting off access to rare earth elements we may badly need. And before you think ""rare earth elements"" are just some fancy powder Gwyneth Paltrow adds to a morning smoothie to enhance vaginal wellness, you should know they're actually essential for everything from wind turbines to computer chips to F-35 stealth fighter jets. And incredibly, that Whoville tax accountant wasn't even the most reckless player in the Trump administration's messaging to China this week, because J.D. Vance, true to form, was even more of a dick. What has the globalist economy gotten the United States of America? And the answer is, fundamentally, it's based on two principles. Incurring a huge amount of debt to buy things that other countries make for us. And to make it a little bit more crystal clear, we borrow money from Chinese peasants to buy the things those Chinese peasants manufacture. Wow. I know it is hard to take from someone with this accent, but you are really not supposed to use the word ""peasants"" anymore. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) That is incredibly insulting, especially coming from the man who, remember, is next in line to run the country, if anything were to happen to Elon Musk. -So... -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...it is no wonder those comments went down pretty badly in China. WILL RIPLEY: The government's response? Swift and scathing. (SPEAKING IN MANDARIN) TRANSLATOR: It's both astonishing and lamentable to hear this vice president make such ignorant and disrespectful remarks. WILL: On China's tightly controlled internet, government censors are allowing Vance's interview to go viral, amplifying the outrage, igniting anger and sarcasm. ""Have you said thank you for the money we lent you?"" A reference to China being the second largest foreign holder of US government debt and that infamous Oval Office exchange with Ukraine's president. Yeah, that's a pretty solid burn. And I guess, in a way, it's reassuring to know that despite our differences, the American and Chinese people can come together to agree that it is fun to dunk on this cursed Cabbage Patch bitch. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) -And look, you can say, ""Well, that's all well and good, but I still trust Trump to make a deal."" But here's the thing. We actually know what happens when he starts a trade war, because remember, he did a version of this in his first term, and it didn't go great. If you look back at his tariffs back then protecting specific products and industries, like washing machines and steel, they might have worked in a narrow sense by creating modest job gains. They're credited with creating or saving several thousand jobs in the steel industry and creating around 1,800 jobs manufacturing washing machines. But in the broader sense, those jobs cost us a lot. Trump's tariffs wound up raising prices to the point where it's estimated American consumers and businesses had to pay more than 900,000 dollars a year for every steel job created and over 800,000 dollars a year for each job making washing machines, putting the total cost of those jobs in the billions of dollars. And that's before you get to the fact that because his tariffs on metals drove up costs for other industries, one study estimated they actually resulted in as many as 75,000 fewer manufacturing jobs. And when it comes to China in particular, his first-term tariffs did bring in billions by raising the costs of their goods here. But the broader damage to American farmers after China retaliated was so severe that 92 percent of what we collected went right back out the door in the form of bailouts to them. And the kicker is, we didn't get much out of all of that. Because after a trade agreement was reached, Trump excitedly bragged he'd got China to commit to purchase an additional 200 billion dollars in US products. But later analysis showed it effectively bought none of those goods. None of them. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) But please, don't worry. I'm sure Trump definitely learned his lesson, and this time, he's gonna get an empty promise for 500 billion. Fool him once, shame on him. Fool him twice, that's basically what everyone does. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And remember, Trump's first-term tariffs are absolutely dwarfed by what he's done over the last two weeks. And it's not like he's negotiating from a particularly strong position right now because everyone knows he just blinked. The bond markets got the yippies and he blinked. And again, it's good that that happened. I'm glad he blinked. But it's weird to claim it's a brilliant negotiating tactic when you've already backed down before a single deal is reached. And the thing is, this could all cost us an awful lot because maybe the most striking thing over the past two weeks has been the degree to which it's become clear the world's trust in America has been shattered. This isn't just the ordinary give and take of negotiations. Countries are openly saying things are different now. Canada's prime minister actually summed it up pretty well the day after Trump's initial round of tariffs were announced. The global economy is fundamentally different today than it was yesterday. The system of global trade anchored on the United States that Canada has relied on since the end of the Second World War, a system that, while not perfect, has helped to deliver prosperity for our country for decades, is over. While this is a tragedy, it is also the new reality. Wow. That is a bleak thing to hear. ""Tragedy is the new reality"" is a grim summation of the state of world affairs, but also, I'm just gonna say it, kind of a fucking bar. Honestly, you slap that title on a new Fall Out Boy album, the girls are going feral. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And it's not just world leaders. Investors are making it clear they no longer have the trust they once did in the stability of the American economy. Usually, when the stock market drops, the market for US government bonds improves because they're seen as a safe investment. This week, though, they both went down, which is a terrible sign. As one economist put it, ""Investors and central banks are selling treasuries and dollars due to a loss of confidence and credibility in American assets. Financial chaos has its cost."" That is bad. And by the way, that is from Friday, after the pause was announced. And that is the thing, while everyone may want to pretend that this crisis is past us, it's just not. Even Chuck Schumer seemed to miss that point when he tweeted out, ""History will remember April 9th, 2025 as America's actual liberation day. The day that President Trump backed down from his ridiculous tariff fiasco."" But it's not over, Chuck. We dodged a bullet, but the monkey still has a gun. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And incidentally, if anyone watching this is close to Chuck Schumer right now, please take his phone, take it out of his hand, and throw it into the fucking ocean! So, what do we do? Well, ideally, Congress would realize just how close we came to financial Armageddon and take away the president's power to unilaterally impose tariffs. There's actually a bill in Congress right now, co-sponsored by Chuck Grassley, that would require the White House to justify tariffs and then give lawmakers the opportunity to reject them within 60 days of enactment, which seems more than reasonable. The problem is, you're going to need 67 votes to beat a presidential veto, and Republicans like Senator John Kennedy are refusing to sign on, using this logic. I have not joined the Grassley bill. I'm not likely to join the Grassley bill. The Grassley bill will not pass, and I just think it's a distraction. The most immediate question for me is, the president is a pit bull. He's won. He's caught the car. The question is, what's he gonna do with the car? Look. That is a shitty answer in so many different ways. But the main one is, the whole idiom, ""the dog that caught the car,"" is based on the fact dogs have no plan for what to do after they catch it. That is damning enough alone. No one says, ""He's like the dog that caught the car"" as phase one of the dog's long-term strategy to reshore manufacturing. Also, you're a co-equal branch of government. It is your job to stop that dog, not stand back and say, ""I don't know, guys, let him cook."" (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ""There's always the chance of an Air Bud situation here."" (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Look, I don't know where things are going to go next. We're taping this on Saturday. Who knows what's happened between now and when you are seeing this. Maybe Trump will have rolled the tariffs back even further. Maybe he'll have put even bigger new ones on mangoes. What is clear is that he's destabilizing our economy with no real plan of action. And all I'll say is, if our next episode opens up with me sitting next to a chart of the Nasdaq and Miss Piggy, -it means we are fucked. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)"
07JQr5W3970,Trump & The Press: Last Week Tonight with John Oliver (HBO),LastWeekTonight,Political Commentary (Left),20250519,1709,12077242,160703,"♪ (""LAST WEEK TONIGHT"" THEME MUSIC PLAYS) ♪ We're actually going to start with our main story tonight, which concerns Trump's relationship with the press. It's always been antagonistic. And this week, we got yet another reminder when he was asked a perfectly reasonable question about reports that he planned to accept a luxury jet from Qatar. REPORTER: You're ABC Fake News, right? It's only ABC. Well, a few of you would. Let me tell you. You should be embarrassed asking that question. They're giving us a free jet. It's not a gift to me, it's a gift to the Department of Defense. And you should know better, because you've been embarrassed enough, and so has your network. Your network is a disaster. ABC is a disaster. That is pretty hostile, though I actually agree that ABC should be embarrassed. Just not for that entirely legitimate question, but for the fact that, as of taping, they still haven't renewed Doctor Odyssey for season two. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) What the fuck are you doing, ABC? It's sexy ER on a boat. It's The Pitt with sharks. It's got, and I'm not even going to try and beat their tagline on this, ""big deck energy."" (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) In its pilot episode alone, it featured a water slide injury, someone overdosing on shrimp, and this. DR. MAX BANKMAN: What happened? It... It broke. He's in shock. What broke, Mr. Harrington? Is it a bone? (AUDIENCE GROANS) DR. AVERY MORGAN: Penile fracture. Are you not entertained? (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) How is ABC renewing shows called The Rookie and Will Trent, whose premise is apparently just, ""Despite being dyslexic, -he's become a special agent... -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...in the Georgia Bureau of Investigation""? What?! (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) But they haven't renewed the only show brave enough to answer the question, ""What if sick, but boat?"" I shouldn't complain about the other shows. I shouldn't care that a show called and about a rookie is returning for its premise-defying eighth season. And I don't begrudge any audience members for sticking around to find out if their favorite characters will or won't Trent. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) All I'm saying is ABC's The View has been on since 1997 and ""Dr. Hot Boat"" is still in limbo. You're a disgrace, ABC! Your network is a disaster. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) The problem is, Trump clearly only likes when people are nice to him, and the press, by covering the things he says and does and the way he says and does them, is, in his opinion, being mean. Back in his first campaign, he attacked journalists constantly, calling Jake Tapper ""Fake Tapper,"" Maggie Haberman ""Maggot Hagerman,"" and Katie Tur ""Little Katie,"" which compared to the others is just lazy. Little Katie sounds like a doll from the 1970s that was discontinued for giving children lead poisoning. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) But in his second term, Trump's administration has escalated those attacks on the press, from making it easier to subpoena journalist records, to detaining a Tufts University student after she'd co-authored an op-ed on Gaza, to Trump calling for Republicans to defund NPR and PBS, calling them ""radical left monsters that so badly hurt our country."" And in March, he even went to the DOJ to issue this chilling announcement. I believe that CNN and MSDNC, who literally write 97.6 percent bad about me, are political arms of the Democrat Party. And in my opinion, they're really corrupt and they're illegal. What they do is illegal. And it has to stop. It has to be illegal. Okay. ""What the press does has to be illegal"" is obviously extremely bad, but I also want to talk about that 97.6 percent real quick, because I'm genuinely surprised that he knew that made-up number would sound more authentic if he added a decimal point. -A decimal... -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...just feels more like a real number, even if it isn't. If I tell you 20 percent of Taco Bell ground beef is actually horse, you're like, ""No way, number's too round."" -But... -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...if I say 21.6 percent is horse, you'd be like, ""Mmm, he wouldn't make up a number that specific."" (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Now, to be clear, I wouldn't say either of those numbers, though, because we all know that the real number is significantly higher, but apparently, legally, -I can't say that, so I won't. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And unfortunately, even as Trump's aggression has gone up, some owners of press outlets have gotten more submissive. During Trump's first term, a lot of outlets positioned themselves as ""fierce watchdogs for truth."" The Washington Post, for instance, adopted the slogan, ""Democracy dies in darkness."" But this time, even before the election, they seemed noticeably gentler. The Post's owner, Jeff Bezos, killed the paper's endorsement for Kamala Harris. He also ordered that its op-ed page focus purely on the importance of personal liberties and free markets. Bezos has seemingly gone out of his way to cozy up to Trump with his company paying 40 million dollars to license a documentary on Melania, the most Amazon has ever spent on a documentary, and even standing behind Trump at his inauguration. And come on, that's not just bending the knee, that's bending both knees, arching your back, and relaxing your holes. (STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Bezos isn't the only media owner making notable concessions. JONATHAN LEMIRE: The billionaire owner of the Los Angeles Times has reportedly asked the paper's editorial board to, quote, ""Take a break"" from writing about President-elect Donald Trump. Patrick Soon-Shiong has reportedly required editors to send him the text of every editorial and the name of its writer before publishing. That is pretty chilly. And as for ""taking a break"" from writing about Trump, to be clear, I also don't want to hear about him all the time. I don't love that I'm talking about him right now, especially when I could be talking about the recent headline, ""Ohio Police Find Raccoon Holding Meth Pipe... (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...During Traffic Stop,"" which was already good enough, until they made it even better, pointing out, ""When an officer took the pipe away, the raccoon pulled out another."" (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Pulled out another?! From where?! (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) You don't think I want to talk about this raccoon with multiple meth pipes... (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...for the next 25 solid minutes? Of course I do, but I can't, because... even as threats to the free press seem to be on the rise, resistance to them seems to be waning, and in some corners, to a worrying extent. So given that, tonight, let's talk about Trump and the press, how he's tried to reshape his coverage, the levers of power he's using to threaten them, and how we should be responding. Let's start with, if not the most important, the most visible sign that things have changed, the White House press corps. Back in February, the White House picked a high-profile fight with the Associated Press for the dumbest imaginable reason. You may remember, after taking office, Trump announced that he'd renamed the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America. And while some outlets started using the new name, the AP didn't, which led to them being banned from the Oval Office. Something Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt justified like this. If we feel that there are lies being pushed by outlets in this room, we are going to hold those lies accountable. And it is a fact that the body of water off the coast of Louisiana is called the Gulf of America. And I'm not sure why news outlets don't want to call it that, but that is what it is. Okay, to you maybe, but not to everyone. As the AP pointed out, it has clients all over the world, and lots of them still use the term ""the Gulf of Mexico."" So it's not as simple as you're making out there, especially because it can take time for people to adjust to a stupid name change. Sometimes, hypothetically, before we can even get used to one dumb name... (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...some genius comes along and only makes it dumber, then somehow it gets dumber still, and then against all the odds, somehow it becomes even worse before inexplicably going back to the stupid thing it was before. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS, APPLAUDS) Incidentally, earlier this week, my parent company apparently said they ""cannot wait for my hot take on this whole rebrand."" (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Believing that whatever I say about this change was going to be ""pretty hot."" -So... -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...please look me in the eyes when I say this. Fuck you, don't tell me what to do. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) I'm not gonna do it if you want-- Unless, wait, hold on. Maybe you thought baiting me like that would be a good way to stop me from doing it. But on the other hand, how could a company be that smart when they're the same people that came up with so many stupid fucking names?! (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Now, after a legal battle, the White House began allowing the AP back into the Oval Office. And as you just saw with that ABC reporter, other traditional outlets are still allowed access to the president, primarily so that he can shit on them. But increasingly, he is managing to get the sycophantic questions he'd prefer. And even if you haven't noticed that, he definitely has. REPORTER 2: What has made you and your team so effective in finding, locating, apprehending, and deporting these violent illegal migrants? I love this guy. (PRESS MEMBERS LAUGH) I wish more people would ask questions like that. NICK GILBERTSON: Do you think it shows just how out of touch they are with the American people, especially given that 79 percent, according to a CBS poll, approved of your of your speech? I love this guy. REPORTER 3: How come when these Democrat elites want tariffs, everything's hunky dory. But when President Trump wants tariffs, all hell breaks loose? Do you see this double standard? I love this guy. Whoever the hell that is. (PRESS MEMBERS LAUGH) That's really nice. I appreciate that question. That is pretty humiliating, and not just because, ""I love this guy, whoever the hell that is"" is almost definitely how Donald Trump opened a toast at Eric's wedding. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) But it's not a coincidence that Trump's been getting more flattering questions because the White House has increasingly let far-right news outlets and influencers into press events. A recent review of briefings found that four of the five reporters Leavitt called on, most were from right-wing outlets. She's also added a seat for new media, and the person in that seat is always called on first, meaning the press room now features figures like Cara Castronuova, who works for LindellTV, an internet news network bankrolled by the MyPillow guy, who asks questions like this. CARA CASTRUONOVA: Will you guys also consider releasing the president's fitness plan? He actually looks healthier than ever before. Healthier than he did eight years ago. And I'm sure everybody in this room could agree. Is he working out with Bobby Kennedy? And is he eating less McDonald's? That is an actual question a White House reporter asked, and everything about that is unsettling, from the fact she was essentially asking, ""The president's looking hotter than ever, right?"" (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) To the absolutely cursed smile of that ghostly twink presence... (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...of the business Malfoy hovering behind her. You can all see him too, right? Please tell me you can see him. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And when she was asked to spell out her approach to journalism, it didn't go great. You are a Trump fan, right? Yes, I'm definitely a supporter of President Trump. So, will you be able to hold him to account then? I will be able to hold, a hundred percent, him to account. You know, there's, I'm sure, things that will happen that I disagree with. And I have said plenty of times, you know, on the record when I disagreed with his decision. Is there anything so far in this administration you've disagreed with? I'm not going to-- Let me put some thought into that for a second. Um... I'm just overwhelmed, like just overwhelmed with how well I perceive things to be going. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) What?! ""I'm just overwhelmed with how well I perceive things to be going""? (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) That sounds less like what a White House correspondent should be saying to a reporter, more like something you'd say to an acquaintance at coffee before crying in your car for an hour. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And look, stocking the press room with suck-ups would be bad enough, but that's just one of the ways the White House has found to thumb the scale of its coverage. Another has been attempting to weaponize the FCC. Historically, it's at least pretended to be an independent commission, but that is now changing fast under its new chair, Brendan Carr. Trump elevated him to run the commission almost immediately after the election, and Carr made no secret of what he was going to do. I want to start by expressing my thanks and appreciation again to President Trump and to congratulate him again on his historic election victory. For me, as I go forward, the first thing is to get together with the president's team and make sure that I 100 percent understand his agenda. After all, it's going to be his administration, and it's going to be his agenda that we should be pushing. Okay, but that's not what your job is supposed to be. You never want to hear something as obsequious as that coming from someone in a role that's supposed to be independent. For the same reason you don't want to see an NBA ref wearing one of the team's uniforms... (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...or a Supreme Court justice flying an insurrection flag outside of his house. Hypothetically, of course, you understand. And Carr does seem deep in the tank for the president. Trump supporters have celebrated this image of him -wearing a gold Trump pin. -(AUDIENCE GROANS) And after The Hollywood Reporter published an article titled, ""Trump's Media Pit Bull is Off the Leash"" that included this horrifying picture of Carr as a pit bull, he tweeted it saying, ""Woof woof."" (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) One past FCC commissioner said, ""I'm about as worried as I can be about the future of the FCC. I would say Carr is the most ideological chairman we've ever had and the most political."" And he's wasted no time pursuing Trump's agenda. His FCC is now investigating all the major broadcast outlets except for Fox. And Carr's stewardship of the FCC has also been part of a new squeeze Trump's been putting on the networks, with the FCC on one side and lawsuits on the other. Here is how it works. The FCC has the ability to regulate the broadcast licenses of local TV and radio stations. The big networks each own a bunch of those. CBS, for instance, owns all of these. And while the FCC revoking a license is incredibly hard, what it can do is make it very hard for networks to sell those stations. Which, given the frequency of media mergers and acquisitions, can be a real problem. So, networks now have that threat hanging over them, while at the same time, Trump is applying legal pressure by filing lawsuits to put them on the defensive. It is pretty flagrant. Trump files a lawsuit demanding money, at the same time his FCC starts making noises about plans to make that company's life unpleasant. So, the networks settle, in the hopes it'll keep Trump happy and get everyone off their back, and maybe they think twice about the tone of their coverage in the future. Right now, CBS is caught in this exact squeeze, largely arising from a 60 Minutes segment the day just before the election featuring an interview with Kamala Harris, which Trump maintains was misleadingly edited. He has sued the network in a lawsuit First Amendment lawyers have called ""frivolous and dangerous and ridiculous junk."" And to understand just how true that is, it's worth looking at the specifics here. Very basically, it involves Harris' answer to a question about Gaza. And here is Trump's version of what happened. They took Kamala's answer, which was a crazy answer, a horrible answer, and they took the whole answer out and they replaced it with something else she said later on in the interview, which wasn't a great answer, but it wasn't like the first one. The first was grossly incompetent. It was weird. And that was fraud and election interference by their news magazine, a big part of CBS News. Okay, so Trump's theory is that CBS secretly replaced Harris' answer to a question to get her to win the presidency. And straight away, complaining about that is a bit like accusing me of hiding the secrets of my skincare routine. One, I don't have one. And two, even if I did, it doesn't matter because it's not like it worked, did it? (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) But it's worth knowing the only reason he's aware of that ""weird answer"" is that it aired in a promo for that 60 Minutes interview on Face the Nation. So, CBS aired it. They weren't trying to hide anything. And if you're curious, here are the two versions. Here is what aired on Face the Nation. It seems that Prime Minister Netanyahu is not listening. Well, Bill, the work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by Israel that were very much prompted by or a result of many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region. -That is a pretty shitty answer. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) It's like she's trying to express a thought in English but with French grammar. It sounds like someone just shook her awake and yelled, ""Israel,"" at her. So, Trump is not wrong. That was bad. But here's the supposedly much better answer that 60 Minutes aired that night. It seems that Prime Minister Netanyahu is not listening. We're not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end. I mean, I guess that sounds slightly more coherent, but they are both fundamentally celebrations of prepositional phrases and the passive voice. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) In both, she's talking like a high schooler trying to hit the word count. The letter of scarlet worn by Hester Prynne in the novel The Scarlet Letter, written by Nathaniel Hawthorne, published in 1850, symbolizes shame and punishment symbolically. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And the underlying fact is the two answers seem to be broadly saying the same amount of absolute nothing about the same topic, which isn't surprising because under pressure from the FCC, CBS actually released the full transcript of the interview, and it turns out this is her full answer to the question she was asked about Israel, this is what aired on Face the Nation, And this is what aired on 60 Minutes. So the network didn't take her whole answer out and replace it with something from later in the interview, as Trump claimed. They basically aired both halves of a single answer, and that sort of editing decision, for time or clarity, happens on TV all the time. As Semafor pointed out, early last year, Fox actually massaged a Trump interview, because in the version that they initially aired, this was the exchange. Would you declassify the Epstein files? Yeah. Yeah, I would. Okay, then. That is a firm, unequivocal answer. And at that point, they cut away to the next question. But when they later aired a longer clip from that interview, it became clear that his full answer played out a little differently. Would you declassify the Epstein files? Yeah. Yeah, I would. -RACHEL CAMPOS-DUFFY: All right. -Yes, I would. I think that less so because, you know, you don't know if-- you don't want to affect people's lives if it's phony stuff in there 'cause there's a lot of phony stuff with that whole world. Yeah, in one version, Trump's answer was edited down, and people who saw that missed out on the fuller context of watching his thought process go, in real time, from, ""Of course, we should absolutely release the files. People deserve to know the truth,"" to, ""Oh, wait, you mean that, Epstein?"" to, ""Oh, yeah, you know, you can't believe everything that you read about people."" (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) The point is, CBS engaged in a pretty standard practice of editing an interview for length and clarity. Nevertheless, Trump sued them for fraud, demanding 20 billion dollars... -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) -...in damages. And CBS initially fought back, calling the claims ""completely without merit"" and saying that they intended to vigorously defend against the lawsuit, which makes sense, as legal experts have called it baseless and an easy victory for CBS. But here's the thing. While that lawsuit was going on, the FCC began investigating the network over claims it engaged in ""news distortion"" with the interview. And that is a problem for CBS, especially as its parent company, Paramount, is currently in the middle of a massive merger with Skydance Media. And as I mentioned earlier, transferring its broadcast licenses will require FCC approval, and it can sit on that approval indefinitely. That may well be why Shari Redstone, Paramount's controlling shareholder has said she favors settling the case. She and Paramount have also apparently indicated to 60 Minutes they were very interested to know the segments the show was going to be running on Trump for the rest of the season, which feels like a big overstep. Bill Owens, the head of 60 Minutes, actually resigned in the wake of that, saying it had become clear he would not be allowed to make independent decisions at the show. All of which makes it pretty galling that just a few years ago, Shari Redstone chaired an event for CPJ, a group that defends press freedom around the world, and had the nerve to position herself as a defender of a free press. It is truly an honor to be here representing Paramount Global and the thousands of hardworking journalists at CBS News who fight every day for the freedom and integrity of the press. The honorees in this room are living embodiments of these values. They remind us that press freedom is never guaranteed, that it must constantly be defended, and that it often comes at a significant cost, both personal and professional. Wow, powerful words there about the need to defend press freedom at any cost from someone who has seemed to stop doing that as soon as there was a financial one to her. And that kind of undercuts the strength of her statement there. Imagine FDR saying, ""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself,"" only to flip the fuck out after he saw a bug. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) -It undermines his point. (LAUGHTER CONTINUES) And maybe Redstone's calculating that if she just gives Trump what he wants now, he'll back down, but I seriously doubt that. Just look at what happened to ABC. They settled a defamation lawsuit with Trump in December over how George Stephanopoulos characterized the E. Jean Carroll verdict, paying 15 million dollars to Trump's private foundation for his presidential museum, despite experts saying ABC might well have won at trial. But since then, Carr's FCC has pushed ABC for more concessions, like threatening its broadcast license over Disney's DEI practices. And look, as bad as these examples are, you at least might already be aware of them. But there are fights happening at the local level that aren't getting nearly the same degree of attention, but that are just as worrying. Take a look at what Carr's FCC is doing to KCBS, a San Francisco radio station. Very basically, on the afternoon of January 26th, a local community group made this post to Facebook concerning ICE agents being spotted in the area. A city council member also posted about the ICE activities. Around 3:40 p.m., the community group posted that ICE had left. And around two hours after that, KCBS ran a story about it in the classic sedate tone of every radio news broadcast ever. Okay, first, that is a remarkably soothing voice... (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...for a news report describing something as alarming as ICE agents in unmarked vehicles. It's like listening to a YouTube video titled, ""Lofi Sounds of a Man Getting Mauled by a Tiger -to Relax/Study to."" -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) But crucially, that report's also pretty basic. ICE was in the community, community groups and government officials were talking about it, and local news covered it. That radio station was actually one of several outlets that covered it around the same time. Here it is on the six o'clock news on NBC, which actually showed images of the cars and agents in question, and here's the same footage being aired on Telemundo. But it was the radio report that got the attention of a right-wing activist who pointed out that KCBS was owned by George Soros' investment firm and claimed that it had put ICE agents ""at serious risk while an operation was ongoing,"" which it very much did not. Nevertheless, that complaint made its way to Brendan Carr, who later got himself in front of a camera to say this. So, what happened was you had ICE agents undercover doing operations in East San Jose, in part of the town known for violent gang activity, and you had this radio station broadcasting the live location, identifying the unmarked vehicles that they were in. So we have sent a letter of inquiry, a formal investigation into that matter, and they have just a matter of days left to respond to that inquiry and explain how this could possibly be consistent with their public interest obligations. What are you talking about? Covering stories like that is literally the whole point of local news radio. That, and delivering the driest imaginable ad read for a local deck staining company. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Now, legal scholars will tell you this FCC investigation is also meritless. As one First Amendment expert put it, law enforcement operations, immigration or otherwise, are matters of public interest. So if it comes to a court case and KCBS chooses to fight, it will almost certainly win. But it's a little worrying that so far, they haven't openly defended their journalists, who, again, did absolutely nothing wrong. And on one hand, I get it. Fighting the FCC costs money and opens the station up to risk when their license comes up again. But staying silent has real cost too. As that First Amendment expert says, ""Even if charges are never filed, people have to look over their shoulders to wonder, 'Is the government going to come after me because I reported something that the government doesn't like me to say?'"" Sadly, that is a reasonable question to ask now. Much more reasonable, you could argue, than, ""When's the president's workout DVD dropping?"" (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And this feels like where the biggest potential harm may be done because the government, directly or indirectly, is controlling criticism. And that is, to put it bluntly, authoritarianism. We've seen countries backslide, and the press tends to be one of the first casualties. It happened under Viktor Orbán in Hungary and Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines. And those who've watched it happen in person will tell you this is where it starts. And this is also the one chance you get to stop it. Maria Ressa’s a journalist who was arrested in the Philippines for standing up to the Duterte regime. She ultimately won a Nobel Prize for doing that. And she said she sees parallels here with what happened there. And her warning to people like Shari Redstone is pretty stark. Don't voluntarily give up your rights, right? I mean, again, I'll give you our example in the Philippines, where the first-- the newspaper gave up, the television station gave up, largest. It lost its franchise or license to operate. And guess what? It never regained it, even after the time of Duterte. I guess what I'm saying is, ""hold the line"" is the phrase we use, because it's connected to the rights that you deserve as a citizen. And if you do not hold the line at this crucial moment, this is the moment when you are strongest, you will only get weaker over time. Exactly. Fundamental rights and freedoms are worth fighting for. And this is one of the fights that nerds who work in newsrooms can actually win, mostly because it doesn't require any upper body strength. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) So, what can we do? Well, obviously, public support for organizations like The AP and 60 Minutes is important, but we also need to pay attention to what's happening at places like KCBS. And I'd argue there's a special obligation here to any outlets owned by extremely wealthy people, like this lot, to fight back. Don't comply with Trump's ridiculous demands prematurely. I know he and the FCC are making a lot of intimidating-sounding threats and fighting them will undeniably take time, effort, and money, but I'd argue it is very much worth it, especially when the likeliest outcome is that you win definitively. If I may quote someone who I hope meant it when she said it, ""Press freedom is never guaranteed, it must constantly be defended, and that often comes at a significant cost."" The point is, if media owners enjoy the applause they get when they say things like that, now is the time to pay for it. Think of it this way. A free press is really a lot like Doctor Odyssey. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) -It's rare. It's special. We're very lucky to have it. (LAUGHTER CONTINUES) And if we're not extremely careful, we're all gonna miss it terribly when it's gone."
F2hN3JKZ-Go,Trump & Deportations: Last Week Tonight with John Oliver (HBO),LastWeekTonight,Political Commentary (Left),20250505,1555,8649841,144513,"♪ (""LAST WEEK TONIGHT"" THEME MUSIC PLAYS) ♪ We're going to dive straight in with our main story tonight, which concerns immigrants. Once again, named Group of the Year by Right-Wing Scapegoat Magazine. While campaigning, Trump promised a draconian crackdown on migrants, and his administration has since made a big show out of following through on that, from inviting Dr. Phil on a ride along with ICE to nauseating social media posts like this one, titled, ""ASMR: Illegal Alien Deportation Flight,"" featuring sounds of manacles and handcuffs, and this one, which is somehow in even worse taste. ♪ Closing time ♪ ♪ You don't have to go home But you can't stay here ♪ ♪ I know who I want To take me home ♪ That is real. They used ""Closing Time"" by Semisonic, which obviously isn't the right song choice. The right song choice would be no song at all, because deportation Instagram reel is a combination of words that should never exist, like ""Oscar winner Mr. Beast,"" or ""Stephen Miller nudes,"" or ""Bill Belichick speaks about his relationship -with 24-year-old girlfriend."" -(AUDIENCE GROANS) Now, Semisonic denounced that video, saying, ""We did not authorize or condone the White House's use of our song in any way. The song is about joy and possibilities and hope, and they have missed the point entirely."" And of course they have, because according to the band's drummer, the song's about the ""anticipation of fatherhood, a song about being sent forth from the womb as if by a bouncer clearing out a bar."" And obviously it is. We all knew that and got it from the lyrics. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) It's closing time. You're a baby. Get out of that uterus and finish your whiskey and beer. You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here. It seems every day brings terrible news concerning deportation policy, some of which has been so surreal, local news has had to run fact checks on it, like in this sponsored segment. ANNOUNCER: Tonight's ""Fact or Fiction"" is brought to you by America's Finest Carpet. Tonight, we're looking into a comment allegedly made by the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. A story that you may have seen today claims acting ICE Director Todd Lyons said that he would like the agency to be run like Amazon Prime for human beings. And this is true. Yeah, it is true. And spare a quick thought for that station and its sponsor, America's Finest Carpet. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Because verifying ICE's director wanted to expel humans with the speed of a pack of emergency tampons on same-day delivery clearly isn't what their ""Fact or Fiction"" segment is for. It's for getting to the bottom of actual questions that they've answered like, ""Sharks test positive for cocaine?"" ""Woman arrested for cinnamon roll attack?"" and ""Ford creates 'very gay' raptor?"" Which you'll be pleased to know was very much fact. But the intention behind that Amazon Prime idea gets to something important here. For all this administration's talk of prioritizing hardened criminals, in practice, it seemed to value speed, volume, and spectacle over all else. Perhaps best summed up by the fact, at a rally on Tuesday, Trump directed the audience's attention to a grotesque video of men getting deported to a Salvadoran prison, being marched off an airplane, and having their heads shaved. Prefacing it by telling the cheering crowd those men were ""the worst of the worst."" Despite the fact, when 60 Minutes looked into it, they couldn't find criminal records for 75 percent of the men on those flights. And Trump's own administration has conceded that at least one man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, was sent there due to an administrative error. For weeks now, it has been scrambling to come up with reasons why it was okay to send that man to a foreign prison, which has been hard for them to do given that he had a court order protecting him from deportation to El Salvador and no criminal record. At one point, Trump posted a photo of himself holding an image that had been circulating online of Abrego Garcia's hand with labels added, suggesting the tattoos on his knuckles were somehow secret code spelling out MS-13. Multiple gang experts have disputed that, pointing out MS-13 tattoos tend to feature things like the letters ""M"" and ""S"" and the numbers ""1"" and ""3."" But in an interview on Tuesday, Trump not only defended posting that image, he argued that the letters and numbers that had clearly been superimposed were actually tattooed on his hand, and he refused to let go of that idea for an agonizingly long time. And while you may have seen small clips of this exchange, it is worth watching the full 90 seconds, because it is absolutely incredible. The man that you picked out, he said he wasn't a member of a gang, and then they looked, and on his knuckles he had ""MS-13."" -There's a dispute over that. -Wait a minute, wait a minute. He had ""MS-13"" on his knuckles, tattooed. He had some tattoos that are interpreted that way. -But let's move on. -Wait a minute. Hey, Terry, Terry, Terry. He did not have the letter ""MS-13."" -It says ""MS-13."" -That was Photoshopped. -So let me just-- -That was Photoshopped? Terry, you can't do that. Hey, they're giving you the big break of a lifetime. You know, you're doing the interview. I picked you because, frankly, I never heard of you, but that's okay. I picked you. Terry, but you're not being very nice. He had ""MS-13"" tattooed. TERRY MORAN: We'll agree to disagree. I want to move on to something else. Do you want me to show you the picture? TERRY: I saw the picture. Oh, and you think it was Photoshopped? -Well... -TERRY: Here we go. Don't Photoshop it. Go look at his hand. He had ""MS-13."" He did have tattoos that can be interpreted that way. I'm not an expert on them. I want to turn to Ukraine. No, no. Terry, Terry. No, no. No, no. He had ""MS,"" as clear as you can be, not interpreted. This is why people no longer believe the news, because it's fake news. When he was photographed in El Salvador, they aren't there. But let's just go on. They aren't there when he's in El Salvador. Oh, they weren't there, but they're there now, right? -No. -But they're there now. -They're in your picture. -Terry. Ukraine, sir. He's got ""MS-13"" on his knuckles. Okay? We'll take a look at that. It's such a disservice. TERRY: We'll take a look at that, sir. Why don't you just say, ""Yes, he does,"" and, you know, go on to something else. It's contested. Terry! Terry! Terry! You're in hell, Terry! (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Terry, this is hell right now. I'm genuinely shocked Trump doesn't drink alcohol because that is the most ""drunk at an IHOP"" conversation I think I've ever heard. And no disrespect to Terry, but maybe don't move on from that. I know you've got other questions to get to, but if the president of the United States is trying to tell you that this amateur hour Photoshop is real, let him go get the picture and make him say it again. Point to that Helvetica-looking ""M"" and make the president say, ""Yes, I believe that artless 'M,' that's weirdly clearer and darker than all the other tattoos, is real."" Make him say, ""I believe that man went to a tattoo parlor and said, 'The skull's pretty spooky, but what I'd really like is a neatly aligned '3' directly on the bone of my knuckle, and can you please make it so that it doesn't stretch or bend with the natural curves of the human hand, and also make it look like a typewriter did it?'"" Because, Terry, sometimes... when Trump's doing his normal racist blue-skying, you do need to cut him off to slow the flow of hatred into the world. But if he wants to tell America that this laughably doctored picture is evidence of a major threat to American safety, you have an obligation to let the man cook. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS, CHEERS) And for what it's worth... if Trump's going to hash out those claims, he probably should be doing that in court, not on TV, and after he's already shipped someone off to a foreign prison. But Abrego Garcia is just one of many horrifying stories surrounding immigration right now, from tourists being detained for weeks, to US citizens being caught up in ICE dragnets, to videos like this. ALYSHA PALUMBO: You can see an agent using a large hammer to break the back passenger window of their car. Marilu said the agents were focused on her husband, Juan, but kept calling him Antonio. That's the name of another man who lives in their building. Thinking this is a case of mistaken identity, Juan called his attorney, who told him to stay in the car until she got there. But instead of waiting for their lawyer, the agent smashed the car window, broke into the vehicle, and dragged the couple out. MARILU: They had no reason to detain him. We've been following the rules of this country. We are doing things the right way. That's why we have a lawyer. Right. They're trying to do things the right way. We have an asylum process in place. And while it is not perfect, I don't think a key step in it is ""guy smashes your car with a hammer while screaming someone else's name at you."" But that's just the tip of the iceberg here. So, given that, tonight, let's look at Trump and deportations, the aggression of his administration's crackdowns, its blatant contempt for the law, and where this could be heading. Let's start with the fact Trump's off to a much quicker start than last time around. In its first 100 days, this administration has taken 181 immigration-specific executive actions, a six-fold increase over that same period in Trump's first term. And that is deliberate. As the head of one anti-immigration group that advised the White House has put it, the plan has been to ""do everything, all at once, everywhere."" Which sounds less like rational government policy and more like a knock-off DVD sold on the subway. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And to do that, they've employed a wide variety of tactics. Sometimes they've gotten creative by looking through old statutes for cheat codes to expedite deportations. We've talked before about how they've tried using an obscure provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act to remove people if the Secretary of State has reasonable ground to believe their presence here would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences. That is the reason they gave for arresting students like Mahmoud Khalil. And while that was clearly a targeted attempt to frighten students out of voicing solidarity with Palestine, they've also taken much broader swings using a federal database that tracks even the slightest interactions with law enforcement to revoke visas and put thousands of international students in jeopardy. And some of the cases have been truly absurd, like this grad student who was suddenly told he had 15 days to leave the country. PATRICK TERPSTRA: Suguru Onda, getting a PhD at Brigham Young University in Utah, had his legal status in the US suddenly revoked after a criminal records check. But Onda, from Japan, had no criminal charges on his record, just two speeding tickets and a citation for catching ""one too many fish,"" his attorney says. That is ridiculous. If you can be flagged for deportation for catching ""one too many fish,"" then I truly fear for Henry Winkler. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) We could be just days away from seeing him -in an El Salvador prison. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Which I'm sure the White House will then justify by badly photoshopping an ""MS-13"" tattoo onto his neck. And while they later reversed that specific decision, this all feels like the inevitable result of a campaign that fearmongered about an epidemic of so-called ""migrant crime,"" which, as we've discussed before, was wildly overblown. But having promised mass deportations and even printed signs for people to wave around demanding them, they're now scrambling to deliver. While the administration denies it, ICE officials have reportedly been told to aggressively ramp up the number of people they arrest, from a few hundred per day to at least 12 to 1,500, with the idea being each of the agency's field offices should make 75 arrests per day. And for all of this administration's promises of a ""worst-first"" strategy, where they focus on those with criminal histories, as a former director of ICE pointed out three months ago, that was always unlikely to last. REPORTER: Sarah Saldaña believes if arrest numbers don't increase as rapidly as the administration hopes, it might abandon the worst-first strategy and begin targeting community locations like day labor sites. SARAH SALDAÑA: That is really a big concern of mine, because that's not, again, a stretch, to think that that might happen next. If the numbers are not coming through, let's get the low-hanging fruit. Right. And you should avoid low-hanging fruit. I tried to do that. If I were to constantly go for low-hanging fruit, I'd say that ""worst-first"" doesn't describe Trump's immigration policy so much as it describes his children. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) -But again, I've avoided saying that because I have standards, so I won't do it. (AUDIENCE APPLAUDS) And the administration now seems desperate to scoop anyone up. Police in places like Upstate New York have been stopping Hispanic drivers for minor traffic violations, and if they're undocumented, handing them over to Border Patrol agents. Also, at one point, tens of thousands of people received emails explicitly telling them to please leave the United States immediately. Some of those were sent by mistake to American citizens, while others went to migrants with a legal right to be here. The fact is, what the administration is doing is sometimes targeted, sometimes arbitrary, usually blatantly racist, and always cruel, and sometimes breathtakingly so. REPORTER 2: Tonight, the administration is facing criticism from migrant advocates over the removal of two American citizen children of an undocumented woman from Honduras, including her four-year-old son. A migrant rights group says he was sent to Honduras without his medication for stage 4 cancer. How is going after families with young kids targeting the worst of the worst? First of all, we said we were going to prioritize the worst of the worst. You feel like that's what you're doing? Absolutely. But when you prioritize something, it doesn't mean you forget about everybody else. I said from day one, if you're in the country illegally, you're not off the table. Okay, first, Tom Homan can truly rot in hell. -(AUDIENCE CHEERS) -Though I'd expect nothing less from a man who clearly answers the question, what would Shrek look like as a white ogre? (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And while the government insists that woman ""chose"" to have her son deported with her, her lawyers insist that was not, in fact, the case. And either way, between the government putting that kid on a plane without his medication and the cuts to research at the NIH, it seems this administration's actively coming out pro-pediatric cancer. I feel there's a non-zero chance Trump's about to add a fucking brain tumor to his cabinet and then presumably RFK's either going to eat it or point at it and say, ""It's from Wi-Fi."" But one of the boldest moves they've made to circumvent due process is invoking what's called the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 law that ""allows the president to detain or deport non-citizens without a hearing and based only on their country of birth or citizenship, if he decides that an invasion or predatory incursion by that country is underway."" It was famously used to justify the internment of Japanese, Italian, and German immigrants in World War II, but Trump has now invoked it again, saying, ""It lets us do a lot of the things we wouldn't be able to do."" He's issued an absurd proclamation, declaring a Venezuelan gang called Tren de Aragua, or TDA, has invaded the United States. And he's used that as a pretext to sweep people up in raids, label them as gang members, and deport them. Some have been shipped off to CECOT, a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador. And if you've only seen it in Trump's propaganda videos or in Kristi Noem's grotesque photo-op, it is worth knowing just how grim it is in there. DAVID CULVER: Inmates are assigned to one of eight sectors, each roughly the size of an airplane hangar, basically prisons within the prison. Once inside, it's said to be a life sentence. They'll never leave their assigned sector. Each sector holds more than two dozen large cells, roughly 80 inmates per cell, but that can fluctuate. Inside each cell, toilets, a concrete basin for bathing, and a barrel of drinking water, several rows of metal bunk beds. No mattresses, no sheets, no privacy. Yeah, it is awful in there. The Salvadoran Justice and Security Minister has even bragged that ""no one who enters the CECOT will ever walk out. They will only be able to leave in a coffin."" And, ""You'll only be able to leave in a coffin,"" is a horrifying statement no matter where it is. Even if it was on a sign outside a literal coffin dealership... (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...it'd be a bit much. I get you're just trying to make a sale, but come on, tone it down. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And look, sending anyone there is unforgivable, whatever they're accused of. But it's worth noting, we've not only done it without due process, in many cases, we've done it without cause. Remember, on those first plane loads, three-quarters of the people had no discernible criminal record. And while Tom Homan has insisted that that doesn't mean anything because ""a lot of gang members don't have criminal histories,"" you clearly shouldn't be sending people to a Central American forever dungeon just on vibes. And the government's evidence in some of these cases is just absurdly weak. Take Andry Hernandez Romero, a Venezuelan stylist who was in the middle of seeking asylum in the US to escape persecution for his political views and the fact that he's gay. Time magazine photographed him having his head shaved upon arrival at CECOT, with the photographer saying he was ""crying for his mother."" And as his lawyer points out, the evidence the government's shown to justify that is ridiculous. CECILIA VEGA: In Andry's case, the only evidence the government presented in immigration court were these pictures of his tattoos. Crowns, which immigration authorities say can be a symbol of Tren de Aragua. LINDSAY TOCZYLOWSKI: The crowns themself were on top of the names of his parents. The most plausible explanation for that are that his mom and dad are his king and queen. CECILIA: A Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman said on social media that its intelligence assessments go well beyond just gang affiliate tattoos. She said Andry's own social media indicates he is a member of Tren de Aragua. We went back a decade and could only find photos like these. That is utterly infuriating. That is your evidence? What about this man screams violent gang member? The only thing I'm actually confident he's a genuine threat to is unaccented cheekbones. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) -And for what it's worth, there are no tattoos that denote membership to TDA. An expert who wrote the book on them has said Venezuelan gangs are not identified by tattoos. But apparently the Trump administration's been relying on an Alien Enemy Validation Guide, specifically its scoring system, under which eight points are required for any individual to be identified as a member of Tren de Aragua. But that is not a high bar, as you can get four points simply for having tattoos denoting membership or loyalty to TDA, which, again, is not a thing, and four points if you display logos or dress known to indicate allegiance to TDA, which can be as simple as being dressed in high-end urban streetwear, especially basketball jerseys from the Chicago Bulls. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) But that is clearly bullshit, because if that is all it takes, then 75 percent of the city of Chicago are TDA from October to April. And somehow, it gets even dumber. CECILIA: Tattoos and social media were also used to link another Venezuelan migrant, Jerce Reyes Barrios, to the Tren de Aragua gang. Immigration court documents include this Facebook post from 14 years ago, showing him flashing what officers said was a gang sign. His girlfriend told us it was all about rock and roll. Immigration agents also flagged Jerce's crown tattoo as a gang symbol, but they did not mention the crown is above a soccer ball. Jerce was a soccer player in Venezuela. His lawyer says the tattoo honors his favorite team, Real Madrid. That is pathetic. And as for this picture of Jerce supposedly throwing up gang signs, if that were true, Rihanna, Fergie, and Former President George W. Bush are all Tren de Aragua too. (AUDIENCE CHEERS, APPLAUDS) But when confronted on this in court, the government's been completely unrepentant. Early on, they violated a judge's orders to turn around planes carrying deportees to El Salvador. And even after the Supreme Court explicitly directed they facilitate Abrego Garcia's release from custody there, they've chosen to dick around about the exact meaning of the word ""facilitate."" As for Trump, when he was pressed on whether the people he sent to El Salvador deserved any sort of due process, he said this. You know, we have thousands of people that are ready to go out. And you can't have a trial for all of these people. And a judge can't say, ""No, you have to have a trial."" The trial is going to take two years. And we're going to have a very dangerous country if we're not allowed to do what we're entitled to do. But that's not how anything works. You can't just opt out of due process because it's inconvenient. It's why court orders don't tend to end with, ""If not, no worries! You do you!"" (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And the thing is, this could all get worse, because while thankfully the courts have tried to curb Trump's use of these two acts, they've also seemed to sign off on a new diabolical strategy the administration's been using, involving a decades-old legal provision called ""registration of aliens."" It allows the administration to require undocumented people register with the government and carry proof of that registration. And it is clearly a trap. Because if you register and give the government all your information, you become an easy target. But if you don't, or are caught not carrying proof, you can be charged with a federal misdemeanor, allowing them to label you a criminal and putting you at risk of deportation. And this is already happening. People have been charged in Texas and Arizona using this mechanism. Basically, they can't find enough criminals to deport, so they found a way to turn more people into criminals so that they suddenly can. It's a desperate but depressingly effective move. And that's not even getting into the other plans that they've teased, from Marco Rubio saying, ""We are actively searching for other countries to take people,"" to the administration floating the idea of labeling suspected gang members as ""enemy combatants."" They've also tried to stop anyone who stands in their way. Just last week, they arrested a judge in Wisconsin for supposedly helping an immigrant evade ICE. -(AUDIENCE BOOS) -And on Thursday, ICE made a big production out of serving a search warrant as part of an investigation into these flyers that were posted months ago with information about ICE agents on them. They even released dramatic footage of them rolling up to the house of their target's parents, who were understandably pretty surprised. REPORTER 3: Drone video this morning shows ICE agents moving into an Irvine neighborhood. Annie Yang and YuZong Chang are still in shock after being woken up by Homeland Security investigators. NEIGHBOR: Woke up to this this morning. REPORTER 3: Neighbors captured the scene outside their home. They described hearing, ""We have a warrant, come out with your hands up,"" over a loudspeaker. Never happened to us before. I feel like I was in a movie set or something. I mean, it was so unreal. Yeah, I'm afraid this is real life though. Seventeen vehicles with armed agents did a Zero Dark Thirty on a lovable, middle-aged couple, looking for a guy who'd put up flyers warning about ICE overreach. Fun fact, guess who was on site for that raid? The ICE acting director who said the Amazon Prime thing. Guess who wasn't there? The guy they were looking for, as he apparently ""moved to New York last month."" A mistake, for the record, that Amazon would not make. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And while that's almost laughably absurd, it's also obviously scary and extremely dangerous. And it kind of gets to the heart of all of this, which is Trump loudly selling his supporters the lie that he'll protect them from existential threats, only to further government overreach and state violence, even while deporting makeup artists, unlucky soccer fans, and four-year-olds with cancer. So, what can we do? Well, some of this depends on elected leaders. And to their credit, a number of prominent Democrats have gone to El Salvador to call attention to this, which is definitely preferable to the approach that others have taken, with some anonymous House Democrats quoted as saying, ""Should it be the big issue for Democrats? Probably not."" And complaining, ""Rather than talking about the tariff policy and the economy, we're going to go take the bait for one hairdresser,"" which is absolutely enraging, especially as many voters do seem to get the clear problem with deporting people without due process to a prison for life, even in red states. Here's Chuck Grassley being confronted at a town hall in Iowa. -Exactly! Exactly! -(AUDIENCE CHEERS) -That man... -(AUDIENCE APPLAUDS) ...who definitely owes a real 1,200-dollar ticket... (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...is right on the nose there. The president is clearly not following the law as he is required to. And look, if your elected officials aren't holding town halls, you can still tell them you care about this issue. Call them and say if they believe in due process, they should work to repeal the Alien Enemies Act and amend the part of section 237 of the INA that lets Marco Rubio decide whose free speech is a threat. But in the meantime, we're going to need to help immigrants defend themselves. Remember, those in the immigration court are not guaranteed a lawyer. And if they don't have one, their chances are basically zero. So if you can, it is worth supporting nonprofits like these that provide legal services for immigrants or local ones in your community. And this is an issue where I do think there is a practical value to public protest, because this is going to be in the courts. And those inside them need to be made aware of public opinion on this. Because it can make a difference. Former Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist once wrote that ""no honorable judge would ever cast his vote because he thought the majority of the public wanted him to vote that way."" But that in certain cases, ""judges are undeniably influenced by the great tides of public opinion."" And I would argue the moment we're in right now isn't just worthy . of a great tide, it is worthy of a fucking tsunami. Because this is an absolute outrage. (AUDIENCE CHEERS, APPLAUDS) And it is one where it is important to remind our elected leaders that all people are worthy of safety, protection, and due process. Because that is indisputably, in the words of this country's single weirdest carpet-sponsored local news segment, -a fucking fact. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)"
vjFL-cBcjKc,Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill: Last Week Tonight with John Oliver (HBO),LastWeekTonight,Political Commentary (Left),20250630,1502,8495725,152997,"♪ (INTRO MUSIC PLAYING) ♪ We're going to dive straight in with our main story tonight, which concerns a piece of legislation dear to President Trump's heart. The One Big Beautiful Bill is among the most important pieces of legislation in our country's history. I don't think there's ever been anything bigger. And I said, let's make it One Big Beautiful Bill. We're voting essentially on the big, beautiful, that gorgeous, big, beautiful bill. -Stop it. Stop it right now. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHING) First, the ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" sounds either like a lumberjack with an OnlyFans page or a Pornhub tab for people who come to toucans. -But it is truly massive... -(AUDIENCE LAUGHING) ...and it's currently moving through Congress after passing the House by the narrowest of margins. NEWSCASTER:  House Republicans passed their sweeping version of the president's agenda.  Republicans in the House held two overnight sessions.  In the end,  Speaker Johnson eked out  his biggest victory yet, winning by a single vote.  Though the dark of night  cost him,  one member who would have voted, ""yes,""  overslept and missed it. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHING) -It's true, it passed by a single vote, even though one representative, Andrew Garbarino, slept through it, which is a little surprising given his official portrait seems less sleepy and more high on expired cough medicine. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) The bill's currently in the Senate and Trump is pushing them to pass their version as soon as possible, posting, ""To my friends in the Senate, lock yourself in a room if you must, don't go home, pass it immediately. No one goes on vacation until it's done."" This whole process has been rushed to the point that some House members who voted for the bill later had to admit that they hadn't read all of it. Marjorie Taylor Greene, arguably one of the worst things to come out of Georgia -since the Trail of Tears... -(AUDIENCE LAUGHING) ...was upset when she learned the House version included a provision prohibiting states from restricting AI for the next ten years. This past week, I have come out in full transparency and said, ""When I voted for the One Big Beautiful Bill, I didn't know about this clause."" Yeah, that's not great. Although, to be fair, who among us hasn't approved things that we haven't read properly? It's why none of you noticed Apple's new terms and conditions technically give them rights to your firstborn child. It is true. Tim Cook is pulling a Rumpelstiltskin right now, and he's coming for them as soon as they can hold a tiny little screwdriver. But a lot of people don't know what's in this bill. About two-thirds of the public say they've heard little or nothing about it, but when they do, they don't like it. As polls show, those who've heard a great deal or good amount about it oppose it by a roughly two-to-one margin. Even some Senate Republicans will admit that not all their colleagues are thrilled about the bill's contents. We could spend four weeks, we could spend four years. And when we're done, not every Republican senator is going to want to French kiss this final product. It's just not going to happen. That is such a weird way to phrase that. Why would you force us all to imagine lawmakers -tonguing a stack of paper? -(AUDIENCE LAUGHING) But as regular viewers know, Kennedy loves gratuitous sex talk, from inserting the phrase, ""I like omelets better than sex,"" into a discussion about, and this is true, USAID cuts, to this memorable moment. I can't wait to have your cock in my mouth. -It's always, always good. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHING) And it is important to remember that in the records of Congress, there is an answer to the question, ""What if Foghorn Leghorn was a power bottom?"" And look, as of taping, the bill still needs to clear the Senate, and then go back to the House, and things are still coming in and out of it. But the broad contours are clear. It is a massive redistribution of wealth upward, accompanied by gigantic cuts to critical programs for the most vulnerable. So given that, tonight, let's talk about ""the One Big, Beautiful Bill,"" what it contains, and what it will actually do. And let's start with the fact, when Trump talks about this bill, the main thing he emphasizes is that it will extend the tax cuts Republicans passed in 2017, and add some more, which he claims will be good for everyone. The White House recently said it'll deliver a blue-collar boom, all caps, which sounds like a new special at IHOP tied to the immediately shit yourself, but... (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) That is more than a little misleading, because while the bill does contain tax cuts for basically everyone, their benefits are massively concentrated among the wealthiest Americans. In fact, 60 percent of the tax cuts would go to the top 20 percent of households. And you should know, just about every independent analysis agrees, this bill would add trillions to the national debt. And to the extent the bill's tax cuts are going to be paid for at all, it'll be through slashing programs that benefit the poor. And I want to talk about two key areas they're targeting, healthcare, and food assistance. When it comes to healthcare, there are lots of cuts, both big and small. For instance, the bill fails to extend tax credits for healthcare premiums under the ACA, while adding burdensome paperwork, that would make it hard for people to remain on the plans they already have. And I know that might not sound like much to you, but it's estimated those tweaks alone will lead to 4.2 million people becoming uninsured, which makes them pretty consequential tweaks. It'd be like changing -to ""Rand Paul's Drag Race."" -(AUDIENCE LAUGHING) You can call it just a tweak, but it's about to make everything way worse. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) But the big target here is Medicaid, the public insurance program providing health coverage to, among others, people with low incomes and disabilities. Though, this bill's defenders will insist Medicaid is safe. I'm going to say this very clearly. Our legislation preserves Medicaid, strengthens Medicaid for the people who actually need it and deserve it. Look, we're going to do everything we can to strengthen Medicaid, to preserve it for those who need it the most. Medicare, Medicaid, none of that stuff is going to be touched. -Nothing. -You don't have to. Okay, but there's a few problems there, starting with the fact following through on a promise not to touch something has never exactly been one of Trump's strong suits. Also, the math just doesn't support those claims. As one analysis puts it, major Medicaid cuts are the only way to meet House budget resolution requirements, and the big way this bill tries to do that is by adding work requirements for many low-income recipients who got coverage under Medicaid expansion, effectively removing a lot of them from the rolls. Basically, under the bill, to get Medicaid, they'd have to prove they worked, volunteered or went to school for 80 hours a month. That alone is projected to cause over five million Americans to lose coverage by the end of the decade. Though to hear Mike Johnson tell it, that's just not a problem. Because they're just targeting one specific group. You don't want able-bodied workers on a program that is intended, for example, for single mothers with two small children who's just trying to make it. That's what Medicaid is for, not for 29-year-old males sitting on their couches playing video games. We're going to find those guys, and we're gonna send them back to work. Okay, 29-year-old males sitting on the couch playing video games? How is it possible that Mike Johnson always sounds so old and out of touch while also managing to look like a 12-year-old who dressed up as Stephen Colbert for Halloween? (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) The problem with that argument is that most Medicaid enrollees are working. The most recent data shows that nearly two in three work. And most of the rest have a disability, are caring for family members, or are attending school. And yet, Republicans won't stop painting lurid scenarios of Medicaid freeloaders. For instance, here's the current head of Medicare and Medicaid services, who, remember, is inexplicably Dr. Oz, unloading the single weirdest hypothetical you will ever hear in your life. Here's the metaphor. You get home at night with Lou, and there's someone sitting on your couch in the basement. You don't know them. But they have health insurance that you're paying for. And you say, ""Listen, to keep this health insurance, I want you to apply for a job. You don't have to work. Just apply for a job. Go get an education. Volunteer somewhere. Be involved in the community. Or take care of one of the kids in the family. Help out a little bit."" If they say, ""no,"" you say, ""Well, I'm taking your insurance away."" That's not an unreasonable deal to make. Okay, let's just pause together for a moment and unpack what he just described. In that scenario, you get home at night to find a complete stranger sitting on your couch in your basement. Naturally, the first thing they say is, ""Hi, I have health insurance that you're paying for."" But instead of screaming and immediately calling 911, you calmly say, ""Okay, person I've never seen before, I'll let you keep the health insurance I just found out I'm paying for without asking who you are or how you got into my house. My one and only requirement is that you apply for a job. You can use my Wi-Fi as apparently you live in my basement now, and that's a reality I've quickly accepted. Or you can go get an education or volunteer or take care of one of my kids. Naturally, I trust you, a complete stranger, unexpectedly in my home with the lives of my children."" And then this individual says, ""No, that doesn't seem reasonable to me."" -(AUDIENCE LAUGHING) -So, you say, ""Okay, well, you leave me with no other option. I'm gonna have to take your insurance away. Obviously, you can still live in my house, that goes without saying, you're family now, but you'll have to find a way to pay for your own health insurance. That's not an unreasonable deal to make."" (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) But honestly, the weirdness of that scenario is actually preferable to what it sounds like when Dr. Oz gives you a glimpse into what he really thinks work requirements are for. I have confidence in the American people. You give people a chance to work, and we know we have twice as many jobs as there are people looking for them. Go out there, do entry-level jobs, get into the workforce, prove that you matter, get agency into your own life. It's a much more enjoyable experience if you're going through life thinking that you control your destiny, and you'll get better insurance at the same time. Hold on. Prove that you matter? So a person only means something if they work. That is not true at all. In fact, if ever there were proof that you can work for decades while adding exactly zero value to society, it is Dr. Oz himself who, as we have mentioned before, once did an episode of his show where he asked Cameron Diaz this. DR. MEHMET OZ: Does this ever happen to you? Um, luckily, no. I'm not a girl that gets constipated. -That is... -(AUDIENCE LAUGHING) ...the perfect facial response to that. That was on daytime television. That played in restaurants and waiting rooms. And as if work requirements weren't bad enough, many are worried that federal cuts to Medicaid will mean that states are likely to cut things like home and community-based supports, which will have huge consequences for those who rely on those services to literally keep them alive, as they have been trying to make people understand. NICOLE LEE: receive Medicaid services,  including more than 100,000 children.  But that funding  is now in jeopardy. Advocates for people with disabilities say cuts to Medicaid could mean cuts to home healthcare, services that literally enable some residents to get out of bed each day. I really, truly believe that without Medicaid, without my direct care workers, my personal care assistants, I would be dead. Yeah, that woman clearly deserves to have healthcare that keeps her alive, even in the insane theoretical situation that she somehow moved into someone's basement with no warning, which, to be clear, has never happened to anyone and never will. That would still be the case. And as if that weren't bad enough, and it really is, it is worth noting people not on Medicaid will be affected too, as it's a major source of funding for hospitals across the country. So with these cuts, rural hospitals are likely to be forced to reduce the services they offer, cut staff, or close altogether. And when you take all of the bill's provisions concerning healthcare together, the CPO estimates they'll result in 16 million more uninsured people in the year 2034 than would otherwise be the case. And it is not like people haven't tried to warn Republicans of the consequences here. A few weeks ago, we showed you this clip of Joni Ernst delivering a bonkers response to concerned constituents at a town hall. People are not... Well, we all are going to die, -so, for heaven's sakes... -(CROWD CLAMORING) For heaven's sakes, folks. Yeah, it's pretty bad. It's pretty bad. But incredibly, it's still not as bad as the sarcastic follow-up video that she posted the next day. Hello, everyone. I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely apologize for a statement that I made yesterday at my town hall. I made an incorrect assumption that everyone in the auditorium understood that, yes, we are all going to perish from this earth. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) So, I apologize. And I'm really, really glad that I did not have to bring up the subject of the tooth fairy as well. (STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS AND GROANS) What the fuck is wrong with you? First, did you actually drive to a cemetery for your fun little video there? And second, no one was under the impression that we're all immortal, nor do we think the tooth fairy is real, nor indeed the Easter Bunny. Now, do I happen to believe that leprechauns exist? -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) -Yes, but that's because of a personal experience I once had in Dublin. I don't want to get into it now. Suffice to say, I'm down one pot of gold and I know what I saw. -But in any case... -(STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) The problem isn't being naive to the concept of death. It's that this bill could make people die sooner than they otherwise would. So, that is healthcare. What about the other crucial program on the chopping block here, involving food? Well, this bill also includes massive cuts to SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps. Currently, more than 41 million people receive benefits through it. It's the nation's largest food aid program. And this bill would reduce federal spending on SNAP by 287 billion dollars over ten years. Like the Medicaid cuts, a lot of that is being done through work requirements. SNAP already has those, but this bill's about to expand them significantly, including raising the age limit at which they apply from 54 all the way up to 64. The Senate's version would also strip exemptions from work requirements for veterans, people experiencing homelessness, and former foster youth. And guess who is completely fine with all that? If you're gonna get free food on a staff program, you have a work requirement. It's an obligation to try to work. You might not get a job, but you got to try. Yeah, Dr. Oz is back with his ""pull yourself up by your own connections to Oprah"" bullshit. (STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) That man is a real piece of shit. Which piece of shit? Who can say exactly? (STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS AND APPLAUDS) One estimate found more than five million people would be at risk of losing at least some of their food assistance. And on top of that, for the first time, the bill would require states to pay for a portion of SNAP benefits and cover more administrative costs. In fact, the CBO estimated that in a ten-year period, this would shift about 121 billion dollars in costs to state governments, which has a lot of people worried because states may not be able to afford that and those added costs could force them to shrink SNAP eligibility or even leave the program altogether. And it is not like food banks can easily pick up the slack here, as the head of one in Iowa will tell you. SNAP is the most effective tool that we have to fight hunger in the United States. REPORTER:  for every meal  his food bank provides, SNAP gives out nine meals. CHRIS FORD: of all those individuals. It would be unprecedented times for food banks. Yeah, it's not great to hear the phrase ""unprecedented times for food banks, given they just survived a global pandemic. In the same way that I'd be nervous to hear that it's going to be an unprecedented year for Katy Perry. What more can possibly happen to her? (STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) She went to space and fumbled this historic baddie. Orlando, I need you to contact me urgently. One of my writers is single and is pointing a loaded gun at me as I read this to you. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And at this point, it is worth pausing to explain what's really going on here with both Medicaid and SNAP. Because even if you're thinking, ""Well, maybe work requirements are needed and limits should be put on who gets these benefits,"" there are some important things you should know. First, study after study has shown work requirements do not increase work. What they do cause is large drops in program participation, including, crucially, a lot of people who are actually still eligible to receive help. And the reason for that is something called ""administrative burdens."" Basically, all the obstacles between someone and a program they're qualified to receive, from paperwork to interviews to regular check-ins and recertification, which can wind up kicking them off. This happens much more than you'd think. One survey of people who were eligible for but not participating in SNAP found that 40 percent were deterred by the paperwork involved, and another 37 percent noted the application was too time-consuming, given their family and work responsibilities. And SNAP's administrative burdens have meant that even those who do keep trying can still wind up going without, as this couple with five children learned during the pandemic. REPORTER 2:  their income needs to be under 52,000 dollars. What's your best estimate of your yearly income now? It's like 20,000 or under. For the two of you, that's combined. -That's combined. -That's combined. You've applied for the SNAP program. We've been denied several times. It said that I need to turn in verifications of... end of employment for jobs that Barry hasn't had in years. In years. The company doesn't even exist anymore. Has it been hard to get people on the phone? -(CHUCKLES) -Yes. Yes. Yeah, no shit. I have no idea how I'd get the last company I worked for on the phone either, especially as that company was AT&T. (STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) I guess my best bet for contacting them would probably be to whisper my complaint into a bottle and throw it into the Hudson River. I can't see any other way. So basically, this bill is taking all that bureaucratic bullshit and somehow making it even worse. And Republicans will insist these new work requirements will work and that no one truly deserving will be left behind. But we know that is not true. And maybe the best way to show this is to look at Georgia and a state program called Pathways to Coverage. It's a program that rolled out there a few years ago, and Republicans apparently used it as a possible template for restructuring Medicaid. Pathways offers health insurance with work requirements, and it launched with testimonials from people like this man who owns an auto repair shop. Now, on his face, that sounds good. A working man getting health insurance. Dr. Oz would call him ""someone who matters."" Mike Johnson would call him not-29-and-playing-Halo, so both would presumably think he's a good candidate for health insurance. It's no wonder he became the de facto face of the program. Unfortunately, it quickly became clear Pathways had significant problems, particularly regarding how its work requirement was getting administered. People 50 and older had an especially hard time proving they met the requirements, which forced them to provide paperwork verifying their work status every single month. That can be hard, especially if you're not computer savvy or don't have reliable internet. There were stories like the man who had to spend more than an hour every month uploading employment documents to reconfirm his eligibility, often using the free Wi-Fi at his public library. And this director of a clinic for low-income patients reported that none of her patients had enrolled, and she wasn't surprised. The qualifications are just too steep. You know, I have patients that I have to put ""A"" on the pill bottles if they take them in the morning and ""P"" on the pill bottles if they take them at night. And you expect these people to be able to upload documents and renew their health insurance monthly? It's not going to work. She's right. Benevolent Anna Wintour is right. -(STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) -Because just think about it. No matter who you are, uploading documents can be challenging. Have you ever tried to upload new patient forms to a doctor's online portal? It is a nightmare. You click the upload button and select the PDF of your form, but then the site says something like, ""PDF files not accepted, please upload .gulp files,"" except you've never heard of .gulp files before, so you Google, ""How do you convert PDF to .gulp,"" and the results say that you need an app called .gulp transformer that costs 9.99, and so you go back and search ""Free PDF to .gulp converter,"" and finally find a site that says you can do it with Adobe Acrobat, but first you have to convert the PDF to a MOOCs file, and then convert the MOOCs to a .gulp, and at that point you just throw your fucking computer out the window! (AUDIENCE LAUGHS AND APPLAUDS) Even people savvy enough to navigate Georgia's system found it hard. One single mother wasn't able to enroll because she said the portal crashed each of the three times she tried to apply. And after calling the customer service line, she bounced around from one robot voice to another before ultimately giving up. Even that repair shop owner had his benefits cancelled, twice, due to bureaucratic red tape. He described one of those times saying, ""My head exploded, I didn't get a text or an email, I did what I was supposed to do, but that wasn't good enough."" Which is a pretty startling U-turn from the face of Pathways to Coverage. It'd be like Jane Goodall suddenly saying, ""You know what? -Fuck chimpanzees."" -(STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ""They're stupid, hairy assholes, and if I could strangle everyone until they went extinct, I would."" Jesus Christ, Jane, what happened? (STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And this administrative clusterfuck wasn't cheap either. By the end of last year, the Pathways program cost federal and state taxpayers more than 86 million dollars, three quarters of which had gone to consultants. And 18 months into the program, a mere 6500 participants had enrolled. And remember, that's the program Republicans apparently modeled their new Medicaid policy on. So if that's what's coming on a national scale, that is fucking terrifying. As one source put it to us, the term people use is ""work requirements,"" but that's a misnomer. You should really think of it as a paperwork requirement. And look, I would say that eligible people losing coverage is an unintended consequence. But I think it's the whole point here, because the vast majority of cost savings that you're getting from instituting something like a work requirement don't come from kicking people off Medicaid and SNAP who don't qualify. They come from kicking off people who do, but who now can't get it because of the burdens you've just put in place. It's death by a thousand cuts. And the true hypocrisy is, it is not like Republicans aren't up in arms about administrative burdens in other contexts, because when it comes to regulations on businesses, they just never shut the fuck up about it. I was tired of hearing small businesses say we can hardly make it because of the stack of paper we have to fill out. Every hour spent on paperwork is an hour not spent on growing their business. This paperwork and red tape will bury workers and businesses trying to make a living. Small businesses continuously list Washington red tape and regulation as a top issue, keeping them from growing and, in too many cases, simply surviving. You know, it is pretty striking how horrified Joni Ernst sounds at the idea of businesses struggling to survive. But when it comes to vulnerable human beings, all of a sudden, she's like, ""You know what? Grow up, death happens."" (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ""Worms will eventually eat everything you love. Someday a real rain's gonna wash the scum from these streets. Ernst 2026: We're all gonna die."" (STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And look, I get that red tape can be a problem for businesses, but this is medicine for the sick and food for the hungry. The stakes are just higher. And the burdens this bill is about to impose won't just be kicking 29-year-old gamers and Dr. Oz's imaginary basement squatters -off the rolls. -(STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) They can impact single moms, working people, and those who fear that they would be dead without assistance. Right now, Republicans are trying to rush this bill through because they know how toxic it is. It may have even passed the Senate by the time you are watching this. And while I know there is a lot going on right now, it is worth paying attention to this bill because if it becomes law, We're going to be looking back on it decades from now, the same way we look back at all the destructive shit that Reagan did. And when that happens, Republicans cannot say they didn't know what was in it or what it would do. Everyone who votes for this should be held accountable, or to put it in terms that John Kennedy can understand... (STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ""If you're going to vote for this bill, you better French kiss it. -Hell, you might as well..."" -(STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ""...put its whole cock in your mouth."" (STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ""Because you're going to be married to it for the rest of your fucking life."" (AUDIENCE CHEERS AND APPLAUDS)"

Some favorite methods include planes, hot air balloons, those old doohickeys that go chugga-chugga and then fall apart, and of course, befriending the birds. (STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) The safety of air travel has made headlines in recent years, thanks to incidents like these. TOM COSTELLO: Ten days ago in San Diego, a Citation business jet nearly landed on top of a Southwest 737. (AIRPLANE ENGINE HUMMING) In Austin last February, a FedEx plane nearly landed on a Southwest flight, both cleared for the same runway. And this photo taken from a JetBlue cockpit landing in Boston as a business jet suddenly pulled onto the same runway without permission. Well, that is terrifying. Planes should definitely not be landing on top of each other. And I say that knowing that there is a non-zero chance Tom Cruise will hear me and immediately greenlight a new Mission Impossible -to do exactly that himself. -(STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) I am not saying that he's trying to die on camera. I'm just saying the only way Tom Cruise passes away peacefully in his bed is if the bed is being dropped into an active volcano. to somehow save ""the live movie-going experience."" Now, while those stories are obviously alarming, it is important to say large, fatal commercial airline crashes are extremely rare, and commercial flying is still the safest way to travel by far. And one major reason for that is air traffic controllers, who, as this recruitment video points out, are really the unsung heroes of the skies. NARRATOR: Millions take to the skies every day, and behind their safe flights is a hidden world that few ever see. Orchestrating a symphony of aircraft with expertise and precision, air traffic controllers are the guardians of the air. AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER: It's kind of an adventure. From start to finish, your entire shift, you never know what's coming your way, and that's what makes it exciting. It's a fun challenge to me. The harder the challenge for me, it makes it feel like the greater the victory. We think kind of three steps ahead, and then we have, like, nine backup plans to those three steps ahead. Yeah, it's a lot. Air traffic controllers have to be constantly vigilant. It's not like a normal job where you start a task, then check Reddit for a few hours, then go back to it, but then it's lunch, then you start the task again, but then you need a coffee, then you get sucked into a conversation with fucking Derek, so you vent to your pal Jeanine about how much Derek sucks, then you go back to work, then you see Jeanine laughing with fucking Derek about something, and you think, ""Wait, are Jeanine and Derek friends? Oh, shit."" Then it's 6:00 p.m., and whatever you had to do really feels more like a tomorrow thing anyway. -Unlike that... -(STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...air traffic controllers actually have to get shit done. Together, they ensure the safety of about two million passengers per day. But as you've undoubtedly noticed, there have been signs that our system is under extreme strain, like this story from last month about massive delays at Newark. KRIS VAN CLEAVE: Monday's bad weather complicated an air traffic control staffing nightmare that started last Monday. After a number of system outages, controllers' screens essentially went dark for up to 90 seconds, losing the ability to track aircraft at a key facility handling traffic in and out of Newark. It was a breaking point for about a half dozen controllers, who requested trauma leave due to the working conditions. Yeah, it was so bad, some controllers took trauma leave. And I really hope they spent that time recovering in a place more comforting than Newark, very much the New Jersey of places in New Jersey. (STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And that's not all. In January, a passenger jet and a military helicopter collided near Reagan Airport, killing 67 people. That happened just days after Trump's inauguration, and he rose to meet the moment with his characteristic empathy and poetic turn of phrase. I guess the helicopter was high. And we'll find out exactly what happened. But the odds, even if you had nothing, if you had nobody, the odds of that happening are extremely small. It's like, did you ever see-- You go to a driving range in golf, and you're hitting balls, hundreds of balls, thousands of hours. I never see a ball hit another ball. Balls going up all over the place, you never see 'em hit. It was amazing that that could happen. There was a lot of mistakes made, and it should have never happened, but... Regardless of that, it's amazing that it happened. -You know... -(AUDIENCE GROANING, LAUGHING) ...it's hard to know what to focus on there. The phrase, ""Even if you had nothing, if you had nobody,"" which sounds like a Tim McGraw song that'd play during the credits of Trolls 4: For Whom The Bell Trolls. (STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Or comparing a deadly aviation disaster to a fluke golfing event. Who among us hasn't been on a plane during rough turbulence wondering if the worst is about to happen and thought, ""You know, this is just like when the president's hitting hundreds of beautiful golf balls at one of his many high-class resorts. Those balls almost never hit each other, and if they did, it would be amazing. (STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And while the investigation into that crash is ongoing, the preliminary report suggested that among many other problems, there was a shortage of controllers that night, with one person doing both helicopter control and local flight control combined. And just two months later, there was another close call at that same airport, after which it emerged that a supervisor in the tower had been accused of punching another controller in the face, leading the FAA to dispatch a team of mental health professionals to offer confidential stress management support for controllers. And all of this is bringing into sharp focus just how stressful this job is and how understaffed most facilities are. Because while we'd ideally have over 14,000 certified professional controllers, we currently have just under 11,000, and apparently 99 percent of air traffic control facilities in the US are operating below recommended staffing levels. Controllers have been sounding the alarm about all of this for a while now. At the end of 2023, it was reported that potentially dangerous close calls have been happening multiple times a week, and some controllers argue that the overtime they were being forced to work was a major safety issue. We're tired of working six days a week. We're tired of working ten-hour days. TOM: NBC News has obtained internal FAA documents first reported by the New York Times, detailing controllers' own anonymous reporting of mistakes and exhaustion. Among the entries... And... Well, that's not great. If I had to pick adjectives that I would like to describe air traffic controllers in charge of my flight, ""well-rested"" would be near the top of the list... -(STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) -...along with ""highly paid"" and possibly even ""erotically thrilled by the concept of planes landing safely."" As long as we get there in one piece, I don't really care what the hand under the desk is doing. (STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And when you combine all of that with the fact air traffic control equipment is shockingly outdated and poorly maintained, it's frankly a miracle our system works as well as it does. But we probably shouldn't be running it on miracles. So given that, tonight, let's talk about air traffic control, the people who do it, the conditions they work in, and what can be done to help them. But let's start with the fact that in the early days of aviation, air traffic controllers weren't really necessary. Flights were rare enough that most operated during daylight hours under the practice of see and be seen. But by the late 1950s, air traffic control started to look much more like what we have today. NARRATOR 2: Flight 104 is on its way to Washington. But the flight actually began 30 minutes ago... when the co-pilot filed the flight plan. Within 12 seconds after the flight plan is filed in the computer, flight strips are being printed for the Boston Control Center departure controller and his assistant. The strip is placed in the proposed departure bay well in advance of the departure time, allowing the controller plenty of time for pre-planning. (MIMICKING NARRATOR) Yes, the strip is placed in the proposed departure bay well in advance of the departure time, at which point the metal bird will take to the skies carrying a pilot, a co-pilot, a team of stewardesses, and 100 alcoholic businessmen who will make their jobs a living hell! (STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS, APPLAUDS) Back then, radar was used around airports, but it wasn't used nationwide until a disaster in 1956 when two planes collided over the Grand Canyon. After that, Congress approved a major upgrade of the nation's airway system and created the FAA to take responsibility for air traffic control. And that led to the complex system that we have today, where a plane flying across the country will be handed off among a series of control facilities. NARRATOR 3: As a plane pushes back from the gate, a ground controller taxis you to the runway. Then tower control handles the aircraft that are taking off and on final approach, typically from the surface to 2,500 feet and a five-mile radius of the airport. Then terminal radar approach control, or TRACON controllers, take over until the aircraft is about 18,000 feet and handed off to an en route controller. Exactly. There is a whole series of handoffs you never really think about during a flight because they work pretty seamlessly, leaving you free to focus on important plane questions like, ""If I get up to go pee, will I miss the snack cart?"" and ""If that guy doesn't put his shoes on, can I legally kill him?"" The answers, of course, being ""Yes"" and ""No, but no jury will convict you."" (STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) The point is, in buildings all over the country, people are directing tens of thousands of planes each day, which is a real challenge. And for many, it's an exciting and fulfilling job. Here is one former controller summing it up pretty well. It is extremely difficult to explain to people how fast you have to make decisions, except to, um, emergency medical professionals. It’s 95% boring and routine. It’s 3% exciting and routine. It’s 1% exciting and a little like, ""Okay, this is not routine."" And it’s 1% holy fuck! -Okay. -(STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Okay, first, I absolutely love her. And second, we all have ""holy fuck"" moments sometimes, don't we? For instance, a lot of people in this room right now are probably thinking, ""Holy fuck, we could have gone to see Hadestown, but instead we're listening to stats about air safety."" But when an air traffic controller says it, the stakes are clearly higher. And one major challenge for controllers today is that there simply aren't enough of them. We've actually been shorthanded for years now. And as with so many things on this show, at least some of the blame lies with Ronald Reagan. -(STUDIO AUDIENCE EXCLAIMS) -In the early 1980s, as air travel was booming, the Air Traffic Controllers Union was pushing for improved staffing levels, benefits, and technology. They backed Reagan as a candidate because he promised to deliver on that. But once he took office, he failed to follow through, and they went on strike. And in response, Reagan hit back hard. You can't sit and negotiate with a union that's in violation of the law. -And their oaths. -And their oaths. REPORTER: With those words, President Reagan told the air traffic controllers to be back in the towers Wednesday morning or they'd be fired and face prosecution. I don't care whether he fires us or not. If he does, it's going to take years to get controllers back in the field. Yeah, it's not really hard to know who to root for there. On one side, you've got America's worst theater adults treating a union of essential workers like a terrorist organization. On the other, you've got a certifiable daddy with a fresh bowl and a mustache that you know tickles all the right places. And Reagan wasn't bluffing, by the way. Eleven thousand air traffic controllers ultimately did strike, and he fired them all, banning them from ever being rehired. And that left some important legacies, including a massive, panicked hiring spree of new controllers, meaning that two decades later, there was also a massive wave of retirements. The FAA has never really managed to catch up with hiring since then, and part of the challenge is, air traffic control is a very difficult job, and because of that, there are strict requirements even to be considered for it. There are the obvious ones, like you must speak English fluently and clearly, you also have to be younger than 31 years old to apply, demonstrate 20/20 vision or better in each eye separately, have no history of any form of heart disease, no high or low blood pressure, and no history of psychosis, neurosis, or any personality or mental disorder that demonstrates a potential hazard. And good luck with that! (STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Nowadays, we all spend 20 hours a day watching our friends have fun without us, the Pope is a Bob, the oceans are plastic, and astronaut Katy Perry is back on tour. -(STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) -There is no such thing as a mentally healthy person anymore. Just someone who doesn't have good enough health insurance to get a diagnosis. (STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS, APPLAUDS) Candidates also have to take an exam called the Air Traffic Skills Assessment, or ATSA, which tests their working memory, multitasking, and spatial awareness skills. During one part, numbered balls fly across the screen, and you have to prevent collisions by typing in one of their numbers while simultaneously solving math problems. It is hard. And if that feels a bit like a video game to you, the truth is gaming skills are increasingly seen as a positive here. Gaming skills is a big part of me being a controller. You've got to pay attention to the map. You're constantly scanning and watching what's going on. You're memorizing maps and locations, like they do in certain games. I used the football game Madden to enhance my skills to work the radar position that I was working. Yes! Finally, playing video games counts as studying. -And good video games, too. -(STUDIO AUDIENCE CHEERS) I'm not talking about the fake ones that they let you play in school where it looks fun, but it turns out it's some bullshit about math. -(STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) -No, thank you. So that's already a lot of steps to get through. In fact, less than ten percent of applicants are accepted into the training program in the first place. From there, candidates typically move onto the only FAA academy in the country, located in Oklahoma City, where they train for months on sophisticated computer simulations, but also on this. In the first room that we were, we were in what we call the tabletops. It's our low fidelity simulation. The students will be in that room roughly about three weeks into their training as a tower controller, and it's an opportunity for the students to learn priorities, learn some of the basics that's needed. -(STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) -Excellent. I love him clarifying that this simulation is low fidelity. -No shit, Brian! -(STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) It's a bunch of middle-aged men playing with toy planes. And I know that is a serious training facility, teaching an incredibly difficult skill, but I also have to know, do they make the little plane noises? -Because again... -(STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...they're professionals at work, but I would argue you should not trust anyone who can hold a toy plane eight hours a day and not at some point go... (MIMICKING PLANE SOUNDS) (STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) That academy can only accommodate around 1,800 trainees in total each year, sharply limiting the hiring rate of new controllers. And the failure rate is intense, just over 30 percent. But if you make it through, you get sent to an actual facility for two to three more years of training, and that stage wipes out about one in five of the remaining candidates. And once you add up all the different ways that people don't make the cut, you realize that out of 1,000 applicants, you might only end up with around 50 certified air traffic controllers at the end of a grueling, years-long process. That is a five percent success rate. It's like Squid Game, if the prize of Squid Game was to just keep doing Squid Game as a job. (STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Now, once certified, controllers are typically well-paid and guaranteed a pension after working at least 20 years. But reaching that milestone can be hard, particularly as, as you've already seen, understaffing has forced many into working mandatory overtime and consistent six-day weeks, and their options to deal with the stress of that can be limited. For instance, if you want to take an approved antidepressant, you have to step away from being a controller, potentially take unpaid leave, and then be on a stable dose of it for six months with no symptoms or side effects, before being allowed back to work. And if you go see a doctor who finds you're not physically or emotionally qualified, that can result in ""separation from the service,"" losing your job and jeopardizing your pension. Consequently, air traffic controllers can avoid seeking help. One sign of just how stressful this job is, is that there is a mandatory retirement age of 56, in part because it was determined the mid-50s were the ages in which burnout was likely to occur. But the majority of controllers retire before they even reach that age, which does make sense. You've already seen this is an incredibly difficult job. It's certainly way harder than this job, which is still managing to age me like a banana under a heat lamp, so... (STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) It shouldn't be surprising that controller shortages have continued to get worse even as more attention has been paid to the problem. Last year, despite years of ramped-up hiring efforts, they managed to net just 36 new controllers system-wide as those efforts were effectively negated by attrition, mandatory retirement, and other losses. And look, If it were just short staffing, that would be bad enough. But controllers can also be forced to deal with antiquated facilities and systems. Remember that old movie about how they kept track of planes on paper strips? Guess how most towers still do it today. NARRATOR 4: For all the radar and computers they have, the most essential tool for managing individual aircraft is this, a plastic strip. AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER 2: There's times where you could have 50 of those strips. And that's a way for us to keep them organized. And it's a memory aid for us, so we use those all the time. Yeah, they're using the same technology they had in the '50s. And this isn't some charmingly nostalgic field like blacksmithing or magazine journalism. -This is fucking aviation. -(STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And look, old-fashioned technology can be fine, so long as it works. But the FAA itself has found a lot of its systems are reaching a breaking point. In 2023, it determined that out of its 138 systems, 51 were unsustainable and 54 were potentially unsustainable. The head of the Air Traffic Controllers Union even said this month, ""We have computers, I kid you not, that are based on Windows 95."" -(STUDIO AUDIENCE GASPS) -And here is the head of the major airline trade group explaining the situation to Congress. It's not acceptable for controllers and technicians to have to work with paper strips and floppy disks to operate the national airspace system in the United States. I showed these to some people in my office. They couldn't tell me what they were because they were under 30. Right. Our technology should at least be up to date enough that young people can recognize it. And by the way, if anyone under 30 is wondering what that thing in his hand is, let me explain. In the old days, computers had little mouths. (STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And they were always hungry, so, occasionally, you'd feed them tasty squares for breakfast. -(STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) -And in return, they'd let you play Oregon Trail. That's pretty much how it worked back then. (STUDIO AUDIENCE CHEERS, APPLAUDS) So clearly, we've let a lot of stuff slide. A recent report found there was a 5.3 billion dollar backlog of facility components past their service lives and that for many of its systems, the FAA is no longer able to obtain spare parts as product lines have been discontinued and manufacturers no longer exist. The FAA has even admitted it's resorted to buying replacement parts on eBay. And that is clearly not where you should be buying critical equipment. The only things you should be buying from eBay are vintage Radio Shack swag... (STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...and discarded e-meters from the Church of Scientology. And sure, you are probably thinking, you can't get a real Hubbard Professional Mark VI e-meter. Those things are super rare. And how do you even know it works? To which I would say, actually, -it very much does work. -(STUDIO AUDIENCE CHEERS) You're wrong about that. And I'm currently measuring 12 and a half thousand ohms. Don't suppress me. You're being suppressive right now. Don't suppress me. I'm an amazing human being with untapped potential. (STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS, APPLAUDS) And as for the facilities themselves, they're not much better. Many towers are now decades-old and controllers have reported issues like elevator malfunctions, meaning they've had to climb hundreds of stairs to reach the top of the towers, and bees and biting flies harassing controllers who were directing traffic. A government report this year even included this picture of a radar system at one facility being cooled by a rotary fan, which really puts the ""fan"" back in the phrase, ""the shit is hitting the..."" (STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And frustratingly, Congress pledged to fix these problems nearly two decades ago, after controllers raised similar issues, like blinding condensation at a tower in Puerto Rico, black mold in Detroit, and a tower in St. Louis dealing with the challenge of bats, to which I say, ""Nope, not at all."" (STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) The only towel full of bats I ever want to hear about is Perky, Florida's actual bat tower that was built in 1929 in an effort to quell the out-of-control mosquito population there. The idea being that a tower full of bats would probably eat some of the mosquitoes. It didn't work, by the way, and I'll leave it at that. -Except... -(STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...I actually won't because you should know that the major problem was there weren't any bats in Perky, Florida. So to attract some, they decided to fill the tower with bat bait. It was just bat guano plus the ground-up sex organs -of female bats. -(STUDIO AUDIENCE GROANS) And according to the building's construction supervisor, it smelled like ""nothing else on earth."" (STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) But now, sadly, we really do have to move on. Except we can't, can we? -Because... -(STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...you also need to know that it's unclear exactly what happened next. Some say the bats who came immediately left, while others say no bats came at all. But either way, Perky, Florida had a tower full of bat shit and pussy mush until they stopped filling it with that... (STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...because the guy in charge of making it, and this is true, died, and they didn't know how to do it themselves, which feels weird because the recipe seems pretty simple to me. The point is, not only should we be talking about that more, it is the only thing anyone should be talking about ever. But back in 2007, George W. Bush unveiled something called the Next Generation Air Transportation System, or NextGen. It was supposed to modernize air traffic control by 2025, which is, and this is true, now! (STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) So, obviously, that didn't happen. In fact, a report two years ago found the FAA's budget for new technology had actually shrunk since NextGen was initially announced. And a lot of this is because the FAA is part of discretionary, not mandatory, government spending, meaning it's vulnerable to being caught up in federal budget fights. So, for example, that academy in Oklahoma City was closed for most of 2013 as a result of sequestration, and closed again in late 2018 during the government shutdown when Trump tried holding the budget hostage to secure funding for his border wall. And it is really hard to plan for any long-term overhaul when the money you need keeps getting pulled out from under you. And when you take all of this together, aging technology and crumbling facilities full of people who are understandably burned out, it is just asking for trouble. Here is a supervisor who was among those who recently took leave from overseeing Newark's airspace trying to explain that in response to an incredibly obvious question. Why is that a problem for air traffic controllers to not have properly functioning radar radios and backups? Why is it a problem to not have equipment that works? (STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) I'm not really sure how to answer that. It should be pretty obvious. If I cut grass for a living and my lawnmower doesn't work, that's a problem. Now I have to use scissors, you know, so... It's neither here nor there. But yes, equipment not working properly would be a constraint that would cause issues for you, yes. Okay. Set aside that that man looks like he's about to pull a quarter out of your ear on the Vegas Strip. -(STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) -Or like Santa moved to Miami and became a nightclub promoter. That is a kind answer to an absurdly obvious question, and you know he is good at air traffic control because he somehow landed his answer there safely without hurting that reporter's feelings. (STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) So, what do we do? Well, there have been a lot of ideas floated. Trump's previously suggested privatizing air traffic control, though a congressional research report found no evidence privatization would be superior to the system we already have. More recently, as Transportation Secretary, Sean Duffy has been vocal about the need to increase air traffic control staffing. Now, on the plus side, he has, among other things, offered a pay bump to trainees and continued plans started under Biden to expand training beyond that one Oklahoma City facility, which is a good idea. On the downside, he's co-signed Trump's talk about how problems with the FAA were caused by diversity initiatives, tweeting, ""We need the best and the brightest, not buzzword DEI hires,"" which is both racist and utterly divorced from any of the issues at the agency. And while Duffy recently unveiled a new plan for a brand new air traffic control system, standing at a podium reading, ""Brand new air traffic control system,"" and proposed to upgrade our infrastructure in just three years, the devil is in the details here. And he hasn't released any specific spending plan or specific milestones to achieve these upgrades. Look, here is the good news. People across the political spectrum agree that we have a problem here. The bad news is there aren't going to be quick fixes. This is going to require long-term investment, which is why it would probably be helpful if Congress would make the FAA's facilities and equipment mandatory spending instead of discretionary. That way, officials could plan for investments and avoid getting held hostage the next time Congress fights over budgets. And in the meantime, we need to do everything we can to ramp up hiring of air traffic controllers, because it is critically important work, and it needs to be properly valued. And if we can do that, then hopefully one day we can get to the point where a truly honest recruitment video does not look like this. NARRATOR 5: Millions take to the skies every day. Behind their safe flights is a hidden world that few ever see. Orchestrating a symphony of aircraft with expertise and precision, air traffic controllers are the guardians of the air. I love this job. My entire shift is an adventure from start to finish. Well, you never know what's coming your way, whether it be emergency landing or radio failure, or the elevator in your 40-year-old tower is out of service and you have to climb 15 flights of stairs, which is chock full of bees for some reason. -(STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) -Just a ton of bees. You have to stay three steps ahead. And then have nine backup plans to cover those three steps. And then I have nine more plans to cover the guy next to you who retired and they never replaced. They say they are, they're not going to. Every day they say, ""We're getting someone, we're going to,"" and they're not going to. NARRATOR 5: Despite a lack of investment, decaying infrastructure, and Ronald Reagan... -(STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) -...air travel is still the safest way to move around. My father was an air traffic controller, and I feel a real connection with him here at this job, especially because this is the exact same computer he used. (STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) He had to retire because the doctor said he had more ulcer than stomach. But what are you gonna do? I'm new here. (CHUCKLES) My supervisor gave me this square. (STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) I still don't know what it's for. I've been carrying it around for weeks. You wouldn't happen to, um... No? No? Nobody? NARRATOR 5: At the FAA, we're looking for young, enthusiastic people who know how to solve problems. It's a challenging job, for sure. Uh, but what keeps us going is th-- Sorry. Uh, the power goes out whenever anyone flushes the toilet. (STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Oh, there you go. So as I was saying, you know, what's important is that we're valued. Dave, one flush! We talked about this! DAVE: I'm sorry! Look, would you want to come in here and air traffic control me while I'm on the toilet? Huh, you want to guide me through it? No, I don't. DAVE: That's what I thought! Oh, shit. The bat is back. The bat is back! There's a bat in here! Help! Susan, the bat's back. Grab the broom. DAVE: Help! I gotta go help. Goddamn it. NARRATOR 5: Our brave controllers can handle anything we throw at them. -(STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) -Fucking turn around! -(STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) -NARRATOR 5: Which is good, because that means we can just keep doing that forever. It's a lot like a video game, except we can never hit pause, there are no extra lives, and instead of NPCs... (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) ...it's you and your loved ones on the 12:15 out of Dulles. Game on. NARRATOR 5: But do they ever give up? (MUFFLED SCREAM) NARRATOR 5: Heck no. You can be an air traffic controller too. All you need to qualify is 2020 vision, perfect health, and be up to date on your rabies shots. You know, because of all the bats. (BAT CHIRPING) I mean, look, I'll say it's 95 percent boring and routine and three percent exciting and routine and two percent ""holy fuck."" (LAUGHS) Oh, no, seriously, holy fuck. (RAPID BEEPING) Hey, Flight 269, that is not your runway. Get out of here! NARRATOR 5: So next time you fly, make sure to say thanks to the air traffic controllers, the guardians of the air-- Hey! What are you guys doing? No one else is up here! I'm juggling like 50 fucking flights! Stop posing and come help me! Come on, I didn't realize everybody came down. Derek!

ohPToBog_-g,Jimmy Kimmel & the FCC: Last Week Tonight with John Oliver (HBO),LastWeekTonight,Political Commentary (Left),20250922,1651,8463242,272664,"♪ (""LAST WEEK TONIGHT"" THEME MUSIC PLAYS) ♪ We're gonna dive straight in with our main story tonight concerning the fact that on Wednesday, this happened. ELIZABETH SCHULZE: Overnight, ABC pulling late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel off the air, hours after a threat from the head of the Federal Communications Commission. Brendan Carr called for Kimmel's suspension over comments earlier this week on Jimmy Kimmel Live! about conservative influencer Charlie Kirk's death. ABC pulling the plug. A spokesperson for the network saying, ""Jimmy Kimmel Live! will be preempted indefinitely."" President Trump weighing in, calling the decision ""great news for America."" Yeah, ABC pulled Jimmy Kimmel's show indefinitely and the president apparently thinks it's ""great news for America,"" which is just a weird response to have. Not, to be fair, the weirdest response he had to anything this week, given that he described his dinner with the royals by saying he ate, and I quote, ""whatever the hell they served us..."" But still pretty fucking weird. And look, Kimmel is now one of many who faced consequences for comments in the wake of Charlie Kirk's murder 11 days ago, with workers being fired or placed on leave over posts about him. And very quickly, I was honestly inclined to wait to engage with the back and forth over who Charlie Kirk was and what his legacy will be, at least in part because we're taping this on Saturday, his funeral hasn't even taken place yet. What I will say is a person getting shot is tragic and a person getting shot for their ideas is horrifying. That is true, no matter what those ideas are. And I also recognize that for many, especially those who were the targets of some of Kirk's ideas, it has been hard to stay quiet, as they see flags lowered to half-staff, and hear claims that he debated things the right way. But setting all of that aside, it does seem like some are now willing to weaponize Kirk's death to do things they've been wanting to do for years, whether it's going after liberal groups, trans people, or their remaining critics in the media, and under some shamelessly flimsy pretext, all of which brings us back to Jimmy Kimmel. Because look, it is not news that the administration have been wanting to get rid of shows like his. In fact, it's such an open secret that last Sunday, when we won an Emmy for writing, one of our writers opened his thank you speech with a line that was followed by a camera cutaway that now feels pretty prescient. Thank you so much. We share this category. We are honored to share it with all writers of late-night political comedy, while that is still a type of show that's allowed to exist. (AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING) (STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Well, yes. Yeah, that is pretty eerie. Now, obviously, our writer Daniel -did not know the future. -(LAUGHTER) On some level, that is just a coincidence, like when a young Shirley Temple accepted an Oscar in 1935 by saying, ""Thank you very much for this. On January 28th 1986, the spaceship Challenger will suffer a catastrophic failure, killing seven people."" You know, kind of spooky stuff. But it's not just a coincidence because everyone knew the administration had it in for Kimmel. Even Daniel knew that. And to be honest, he doesn't know a ton of stuff. (LAUGHTER) Two weeks ago, he was arguing that Alfred Molina is more famous than Bad Bunny. He's a very good writer, but he's wrong about a lot of things. And for what it's worth, he will never be speaking publicly -on our behalf ever again. -(LAUGHTER) Because we're now terrified he's gonna drop another fucked up fortune cookie. But the pretext that's been used to indefinitely suspend Kimmel's show is just laughably weak, because while you may have seen headlines saying he got in trouble for remarks about Charlie Kirk himself or even remarks about his death, that's not strictly accurate. The comments that got him in trouble weren't about Kirk. In fact, Kimmel's first comments after his murder were a post reading... What got Kimmel in trouble was a passing reference on Monday night. Now, at the time there were still rumors flying around regarding the killer's motivations, including that he was on the far right, something that Kimmel alluded to like this. We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it. Yeah, that was it. Weirdly, I was actually a guest on his show that night. And I didn't even register that comment, and that's only partly because I wasn't really paying attention. -(LAUGHTER) -And I'm not alone in that. After Kimmel's suspension, many struggled to pick the offensive line out of his monologue, as YouTube is filled with comments under the video like... And one viewer from the Netherlands saying... (IN DUTCH ACCENT) (LAUGHTER) The point is... Kimmel didn't denigrate Charlie Kirk or make light of his killing. The worst thing you could say is that he appears to have been wrong about the shooter's ideology, which, okay. But he was also pointing out that many on the right seem desperate to weaponize Kirk's death, an argument that's aged pretty well given, you know, everything that's happened to Kimmel since. Because that one line set off a firestorm in some corners of conservative media. And on Wednesday, Brendan Carr, the chair of the FCC, and James Cromwell, minus the raw sex appeal... (LAUGHTER) ...went on a right-wing podcast and said this. You know, when you look at the conduct that has taken place by Jimmy Kimmel, it appears to be some of the sickest conduct possible. Frankly, when you see stuff like this, I mean, look, we can do this the easy way or the hard way. These companies can find ways to change conduct, to take action, frankly, on Kimmel, or there's going to be additional work for the FCC ahead. And frankly, I think that it's really sort of past time that a lot of these licensed broadcasters themselves push back on Comcast and Disney and say, listen, we are going to preempt. We are not going to run Kimmel anymore until you straighten this out, because we, we, the licensed broadcaster, are running the possibility of fines or license revocations from the FCC if we continue to run content that ends up being a pattern of news distortion. Yeah, we could do this the easy way or the hard way. As threats go, that is pretty clear. It's like if someone threw a brick through your window with a message that said, ""Shut up or else,"" then followed it up with more clarifying bricks saying, ""By 'or else,' we mean we will hurt you physically,"" then, ""This is the mafia, by the way,"" followed by, ""You know, like in Goodfellas."" Now, in the wake of those remarks, Nexstar, one of the largest owners of TV stations in the country, announced it'd be pulling Kimmel from its stations. That, in turn, seems to have triggered his suspension by ABC. And a key thing to know about Nexstar is that they have a big incentive to keep both Carr and the Trump administration happy right now, because Nexstar currently controls or provides services to 201 local TV stations. But they're trying to buy Tegna, a major competitor, and need approval and regulatory changes from the FCC for that deal to go through, as it would mean their reach would grow... ...which is... All of which is a little bit strange because neither company really sounds like they should be providing television at all. Nexstar sounds like a bankrupt flip phone manufacturer. And Tegna sounds like, I'm sorry to say, an absolutely gorgeous Italian restaurant. (LAUGHTER) The point is, Nexstar badly needs FCC approval, so it is hardly surprising that when Carr specifically said companies should pull Kimmel off the air or face consequences, it quickly complied. Basically, Brendan Carr said ""jump,"" and Nexstar took his dick out of their mouth for just long enough to say, ""how high exactly?"" Now, I should say, Nexstar insisted it acted ""unilaterally,"" and that they... But I will remind you, they didn't need to communicate directly. Carr essentially told them what he wanted to happen on a podcast, then they unilaterally decided to do it. And it wasn't just Nexstar, because following that, Sinclair Broadcasting, another major owner of TV stations, who were also apparently exploring merger options that would require FCC approval, announced that they too would not air Kimmel's show. And Sinclair even cited Carr's remarks in their statement, saying... And come on, Sinclair. As I believe Alandria once said to Huda on Love Island, don't embarrass yourself going too hard for a man. And that's just solid advice for the islands of love and for business. And it is not like Carr himself was trying to dissuade people from connecting the dots here, as when one media reporter asked him for a comment, he sent back a smiley emoji. And when CNN did the same, this is what they got. I don't know if you saw the reaction, the response that Brendan Carr, the chairman of the FCC, gave to Brian Stelter when Brian Stelter asked him for a reaction or response to ABC's pulling Kimmel off the air. We're putting it on the screen. It's a meme. It's from The Office. And that was the actual response by the chairman of the FCC. Oh, very cool. Just when I thought this factory setting white man couldn't get any hotter, he whips out The Office gifs. And look, I like The Office. Who doesn't like The Office? Sure, I could have done without seasons eight and nine, but if it's on at a hotel, I'm not kicking it out of bed. That said, I want you to run through your friend list in your head right now and pick out the person most likely to text you a gif from The Office. Do you have them in your mind? They're your least favorite friend, right? (LAUGHTER) Just be honest. They're the one you invite to stuff just because you're afraid no one else will show up. They're a third string friend. They're your backup's backup. And if you're thinking there's nothing wrong with sending Office gifs, I'm afraid that person might be you. (LAUGHTER) And look, it didn't stop there. When someone posted... ...Carr replied with this meme of Jack Nicholson grinning and nodding. Fun fact, and this is true, the person he was replying to, Artie from Glee. And what a fun detail for historians. I can picture future textbooks now. (LAUGHTER) And at this point, I should probably formally apologize to Ajit Pai, FCC chairman during Trump's first term, who I repeatedly made fun of for being the dorkiest man ever to hold that job. I simply did not know how much worse things could get. So I am sorry I made fun of your big, dumb mug, and I'm sorry that we even made this even bigger mug as a joke. From now on, I promise we'll only use it in the appropriate way to hold the amount of alcohol I now need to get through each news day. And while Carr clearly had fun winking at his involvement and firing off gifs, once Kimmel was suspended, he went on TV to suggest this was actually a spontaneous grassroots movement. This action today by Nexstar and Sinclair, frankly, it's unprecedented. I can't imagine another time when we've had local broadcasters tell what we call a national programmer like Disney that your content no longer meets the needs and the values of our community. So this is an important turning point. Okay, everything he just said there is wrong. First, there's actually a long history of local broadcasters refusing to carry national programs, and it's not an especially pretty one. From a station in the South refusing to carry Sesame Street because it had a multiracial cast, to one that refused to show Ellen's sitcom when she came out as gay. Those decisions don't tend to date well. But more than that, claiming this is simply local broadcasters responding to their community values is pretty hard to take, given that this wasn't a bunch of independent stations taking a stand. It was two of the biggest local TV ownership groups in the country making sweeping decisions for all the affiliates they own. Calling these companies local broadcasters is like describing Coca-Cola as a neighborhood soda shop. Or Boeing as a mom-and-pop plane crash business. -(LAUGHTER) -It makes no sense. Look, the sequence of events here could not be clearer because it was all done in plain view. Carr leaned on broadcasters to take down Kimmel. They did that, sometimes even directly citing Carr while doing so. And then Carr celebrated with a fun gif. That sure seems like a pretty clear case of the government pressuring companies to censor speech. And it is not like even Trump is trying to hide it. As on Thursday, he said this to reporters. Wow. That is probably not something -you should say out loud. -(LAUGHTER) But then, this is a man who doesn't seem to have an internal monologue. In fact, he ended that press gaggle on the plane saying... No message has ever entered his head without being delivered through his lips. And look, I'm not the only one who sees a huge problem here. Ana Gomez, now the lone Democrat appointed member of the FCC, said... And even Ted fucking Cruz, to use his full name... -(LAUGHTER) -...talked on his podcast about concerns regarding what Carr had done while also having some fun with voices. (IMITATING CARR) (IMITATING MOB MEMBER) Look, let's all agree, Ted Cruz is an incredible vocal talent. And he should definitely quit his job right now and go do that instead. -(LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE) -But he was actually on his way to making a much bigger point. He's right. -He's just right. -(QUIET LAUGHTER) And I'll say this, I still don't like that man, Ted Cruz. (LAUGHTER) But in this unique clip of news on this one thing, I must admit, he's not completely full of shit. (LAUGHTER) The point is, a lot of people seem to think Brendan Carr went too far, and it is worth talking about exactly how he's been taking action and what the legalities of it are, because as he alluded to on that podcast interview, the FCC does have a very narrow ability to police content on broadcast television in cases of what's called ""news distortion."" Now, it's hardly ever used that power, as the bar to do so is incredibly high, carving out things like mere inaccuracy and errors stemming from mistakes, which seem to more than cover what Kimmel said. And honestly, I don't think Carr wants what Kimmel said to be the standard here. And I'm not sure that Sinclair does either. Because we've talked on this show before about Sinclair and its long-standing tendency to push right-wing talking points, and it's not like they've been consistently careful in their delivery of news. One of their regular commentators is Armstrong Williams, who also actually owns a handful of stations operated by Sinclair. And he can be pretty conspiratorial. Among other things, he suggested on air that unexplained drone sightings last December might have been evidence of a plot by the deep state against Donald Trump and may have been an attempt to cancel the inauguration. He's also spread wild allegations that Columbia University student Mahmoud Khalil knew ahead of time about the events of October 7th and may even have been... And if Brandon Carr's standard, which Sinclair has cheered on, remember, is that someone cannot go on broadcast TV in the wake of a high-profile murder and inaccurately characterize who might have been responsible for it, then I have some terrible news for them. Because in the wake of Luigi Mangione's arrest for shooting United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson, Williams was on broadcast TV with this analysis of the footage of the shooting. It is obvious... that when Mangione was on the phone for ten minutes, someone was giving him the location of Brian. So obviously somebody else was involved, and law enforcement is not telling us everything. So obviously, someone was giving him very detailed, insightful information on his whereabouts. I'm sure that will be revealed in time, but obviously, you could almost surmise that it was an inside job -to a certain extent. -Oh, wow. -Yeah. Wow. -(LAUGHTER) That aired on nearly two dozen Sinclair stations, and I've been told repeatedly this week that speculating on broadcast television about the motivations for someone's murder without having all the facts is grounds to have your license revoked. And I'll say this for Kimmel, at least he didn't say the word ""obviously"" -four fucking times while doing it. -(LAUGHTER) And look, most experts will tell you, if Carr goes after stations that air Kimmel for ""news distortion,"" he's extremely unlikely to succeed on the merits. But even the threat of an investigation or a delay in reviewing a merger can be enough to get companies to comply. As one former FCC chair has said... And the thing is, Kimmel is by no means the first casualty in Trump's attacks on free speech. He's just the latest canary in the coal mine, a mine that, at this point, now seems more dead canary than coal. In fact, if I may quote my Sesame Street SVU crossover that no one will take seriously, we are knee-deep in dead birds right now. (LAUGHTER) But this Kimmel situation does feel like a turning point, and not because comedians are important, but because we are not. If the government can force a network to pull a late-night show off the air and do so in plain view, it can do a fuck of a lot worse. And I should say, we are very lucky at this show to be in a different situation. We're not on broadcast TV, we're on cable. And our parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery, doesn't own broadcast networks, meaning that we are much less susceptible to pressure from the FCC than, say, ABC's parent company, Disney, or CBS's parent company, Paramount Skydance. That is obviously very good news for us. And I really don't see why that situation should change anytime soon. We are back with what could be a colossal media merger, according to people familiar with the matter. Paramount Skydance is preparing a bid to buy Warner Bros. Discovery. Fuck! Shit! Fuck! Fucking shit! Fucking shit! Fuck it! (LAUGHTER) -Okay, look... -(APPLAUSE) It was... It was fun while it lasted, guys. (LAUGHTER) Whatever happens next, let me say now, it has been the honor of my life to age like a haunted painting before your very eyes. (LAUGHTER) Look, whatever happens to us or to our parent company, it should be clear to everyone that the First Amendment is absolutely critical in this country. That is something even Brendan Carr knows, given that he once tweeted... And I'm guessing that Trump is currently enjoying that dream so much he could break his bed sheets in half. -(LAUGHTER) -As many have pointed out, there are chilling precedents all over the world for what is happening right now. In Hungary, for instance, Viktor Orban's steadily taken over the media since coming back to power in 2010. One of the first things his party did was adopt new media legislation as a ""corrective for leftist bias."" This required media to be ""balanced,"" but the provisions were deliberately ""vague and equivocal,"" and violating them could attract steep fines. And if that is starting to sound familiar to you, it should. It's frankly no wonder Trump's a fan of Orban, describing him as ""a great man, a great leader, a very strong man,"" whom some people don't like ""because he's too strong."" And I've never been more sure that someone told Trump that Orban is a strong man, and he just couldn't get his head around how that could possibly be a bad thing. (LAUGHTER) And in Russia, when Putin rose to power, TV satirists were among his first targets. DAVID HOFFMAN: One of the first things he did was to take control of television, because more than ninety percent of Russians got all their news from television. NARRATOR: During the Yeltsin years, independent television channels like NTV flourished. JULIA IOFFE: NTV has a comic show called Kukly Puppets. And when Putin comes to rise in public life, it features a Putin puppet as well. And he's never portrayed very flatteringly. (GRUNTING) IOFFE: Putin apparently was driven to madness by the show and by the way he was portrayed on it, the way he was mocked on it. And that is so pathetic. I don't know how anything a puppet show could possibly do could end up being more embarrassing for a world leader than them freaking out about it so much that years later, a journalist solemnly says, ""the man was driven to madness by puppets."" (LAUGHTER) But Putin did hate that show and that independent network to the point that he eventually sent armed operatives to raid their parent company's offices and forced it to sell the TV station to a Kremlin-friendly oligarch. And today, some Russians look back at that as one of the key moments when they should have stood up, like this journalist who eventually left the country. The first alarm that we should have noticed was in 2001 when NTV, the independent channel, was taken over. REPORTER: Staff arriving for work were told their offices and studios were off limits unless they signed an oath of loyalty to NTV's new managers. EKATERINA KOTRIKADZE: I remember how frustrated and angry we were. And we even went to the protest rally. But then it was cold, and we had so many other independent TV channels, so we just went home and forgot about that. Yeah, that's tough to hear in hindsight, isn't it? But the lesson there is, it is not safe to let attacks on one show slide because there are currently others. And I know, I've literally said these exact same words about the cancellation of Doctor Odyssey, but I promise, this situation is genuinely worse. And look, it is important to remember that, as of taping, Kimmel is just suspended, not actually cancelled. So ABC and its parent company Disney still have a chance to do the right thing here. And I do get that the easier path for them right now is to keep him off the air and to keep the administration off their back. Though I will point out that was the apparent argument for ABC paying Trump 15 million dollars last year. And how did that work out for them? And the thing is, if the Trump administration overplays its hand and this winds up in court, Disney would probably win. Especially because, while Carr's usually pretty cautious, the mistake he's made in this case is doing everything out in the open. And there's strong precedent here. Just last year, in a 9-0 ruling, the Supreme Court found that... That is from this Supreme Court, remember. All of them. Yes, even that one. (LAUGHTER) So, what needs to happen? Well, I would argue that ideally, Congress should pass legislation sharply limiting FCC Chair's ability to sit on things like license transfers or mergers so that that can't be used as a means of controlling content. Until that happens, Carl will still have tools with which he can pressure companies. But as for Disney, I'd argue they need to stand by Kimmel and his staff. And there are ways that you can encourage them to do that. You could exert pressure on them by cancelling Disney+ or Hulu. Google searches on how to do that have skyrocketed in the past few days. And you can be specific about it because it turns out there's actually a box when you cancel where you can tell them exactly why you are doing it. -(LAUGHTER) -So you could easily write, say... or... or... Which, I will remind you, looks like this. We made that for a show years ago on, and this is true, China's one-child policy. And I don't think that we are not going to bring it back at every possible opportunity. But it really shouldn't take the threat of lost revenue to bring Disney to its senses here. And given, at least as of today, that I still happen to have this desk, I would like to take this opportunity to talk directly to Disney CEO Bob Iger. Hi there, Bob. We haven't met, but you probably know me as America's third favorite Zazu. (LAUGHTER) Congratulations on recasting that role, by the way. It was a fun thing to learn about after the fact. Anyway... One day, the history of the time we're living through is going to be written. And when it is, I'm not sure it's those in this administration who are even going to come off the worst. Now, don't get me wrong. They're going to come off terribly. But history is also going to remember the cowards who definitely knew better, but still let things happen, whether it was for money, convenience, or just comfort. And I know this is something of a tough sell, and it can be a bit of anathema to risk-averse business leaders, but I will say this, if we've learned nothing else from this administration's second term so far, and I don't think we have, is that giving the bully your lunch money doesn't make him go away, it just makes him come back hungrier each time. They are never going to stop. They've literally said that openly. After Kimmel's suspension, Trump posted... And Carr has hinted that The View might be next. The fucking View. (LAUGHTER) Look, at some point, you're going to have to draw a line. So I'd argue, why not draw it right here? And when they come to you with stupid, ridiculous demands, picking fights that you know you could win in court, instead of rolling over, why not stand up and use four key words they don't tend to teach you in business school? Not, ""okay, you're the boss."" Not, ""whatever you say goes."" But instead, the only phrase that can genuinely make a weak bully go away, and that is, ""fuck you, make me."" -And now, this. -(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)"

(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And if you wrote that, lean in close. Everyone else, just please cover your ears real quick, because the next part is just between me and them, okay? -Yes, those are real cats. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) They're my cats, in fact. And I know you're thinking, ""Why are they wearing clothes?"" It's because I taught them shame. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) -Now, I'm about to lie to everyone else and say that they're not real, but you and I will always know the truth, okay? -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) -Okay. So, clearly, they're not real. But another comment under that video simply says, ""Why did I watch this and why does this have almost 16 million likes?"" And that's actually what we're going to be talking about tonight, because that video was made with AI. It's one of dozens of similar videos by the same creator. And if you've been seeing more stuff like that lately, it's because the spread of AI generation tools has made it very easy to mass produce and flood social media sites with cheap, professional looking, often deeply weird content. There's even a name for it, AI slop, and it can come in lots of forms. It can be news articles or music on Spotify, but you've probably encountered it the most in weird images and videos that have begun to dominate everyone's feeds, whether it's images of a Jesus made out of shrimp or videos like Barron Trump wowing the judges on America's Got Talent while his dad plays backup piano, a pug raising a baby on a desert island, or Pope Francis taking a selfie with Jesus -while flying through heaven. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHING) And my favorite part there is AI somehow chose to give Jesus a watch. -And I... -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...love the idea that every once in a while, Jesus in heaven looks down at his watch and goes, ""Shit, it's already 4:00 pm?"" (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ""I'm late to go flying with one of the three dead popes -that actually made it up here."" -(AUDIENCE GASPS, LAUGHS) Slop can be incredibly popular. This AI soup recipe was the seventh most viewed post on Facebook at the end of last year. And at another point, three of the top 20 most seen posts there were AI generated, including this one of a giant fan bed which had 35 million views. And at the start of this year, this image of a horse made out of bread got nearly 50 million views on Facebook and was even loved by Mark Zuckerberg. AI slop is basically the newest iteration of spam. As the CEO of one AI content detection platform put it, not all AI content is spam, but right now, all spam is AI content. And it's becoming a problem on multiple levels. For a start, websites that were previously useful are now becoming much less so, as this woman makes clear. Pinterest is becoming unusable, and I just need to talk about it. This is me just searching “garden,” and almost everything is AI-generated. Like, what is that cat? I keep scrolling, and, like, you literally click on anything, and it’s like, this is so obviously AI, and it’s so frustrating. I want actual images. Pinterest used to be my favorite app and a place for people to share pictures they’ve taken, and for other people to be inspired by those pictures. But now, it is just exhausting and gives me a headache every time I try to use it. I know she might seem calm there, but for a Pinterest user, that is white-hot rage. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) She is seconds away from knitting a full-blown manifesto. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) But it's not just Pinterest. There's now a booming market of AI-generated videos about completely fictitious news stories, like this one, titled, “Judge Fines Karoline Leavitt for Wearing a Cross” misspelled, “Only to Discover She’s a Legal Genius.” It is 37 minutes long, has over a million views, and here's just a taste of the court proceedings. AI GENERATED VOICE: Yeah, the news! You know how the news is. HAL 9000's voice, comic book font, and of course, third-person omniscient narration. That channel has a lot of fake confrontations that follow a similar formula, like ""Karoline Leavitt Bankrupts The View,"" ""Brad Pitt Storms Off After Heated Clash with Karoline Leavitt,"" ""Karoline Leavitt Mocked by Famous Pianist - Then She Played and Silenced the World."" (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And my personal favorite, ""Pope Leo XIV Orders Karoline Leavitt to 'Take Off the Cross,'"" which makes sense, doesn't it? ""You can't wear that in here, Karoline. This is the fucking Vatican."" -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) -""Have some respect."" The problem is, the comment section under that courtroom video is filled with people who clearly have absolutely no idea that it isn't real, saying things like, ""What a tremendous victory for Christians everywhere,"" ""Proud of you, Karoline, for putting that judge in his place,"" and ""Intelligence for once, she is a force to be reckoned with."" And when one commenter points out that the video is fake, a reply says, ""No, it happened, but it was Pam Bondi. I just watched the YouTube video."" Because, of course, there are also multiple Slop videos out there where the exact same thing happens to Pam Bondi. And if that's starting to give you an uneasy feeling in your stomach right now, get used to it, because it seems extremely likely that we're gonna be drowning in this shit for the foreseeable future. So, given that, tonight, let's talk about AI slop. What it is, where it comes from, and the harm it can do. And before we take all of the fun out of it, I'll acknowledge some AI-generated content can be enjoyable. Exhibit A, Catchester by the Sea. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Which makes sense. The whole point is to grab your attention. That is why you'll see visually arresting stuff, like videos of incredibly buff babies, or cute dogs working human jobs, or people transforming into fruits and vegetables. That is actually a weirdly common trend. And I think my favorite version of it might be this. SPEAKER: He's back! ♪ (""MONTAGEM CORAL"" BY DJ HOLANDA PLAYING"" ♪ (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ♪ (MUSIC CONCLUDES) ♪ Okay, I have so many questions there. From why Cabbage Hulk kept his human hands, to why he suddenly tore his own head off to reveal a different kind of cabbage. But the one thing I know for sure is, he better stay the fuck away from my wife. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) -Stay away from her. Now, as for AI music, at first, it can sound pretty close to the real thing, like this country song whose lyrics are only about 15 degrees off. ♪ (""WICKED DUST"" BY THE DEVIL INSIDE PLAYING) ♪ ♪ (MUSIC CONCLUDES) ♪ -Cool. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) That is from a band called The Devil Inside, and one good clue their music is AI-generated is that they've put out over ten albums in the past two years. Other clues include that they complain about ""wicked dust"" twice in the same chorus and two of their top five songs on Spotify are also dust-related, which makes this feel less like a dark country band and more like a secret ad for Swiffer. It is now incredibly easy to create Slop like that, which, as this CEO of an AI music generator points out, is one of its key selling points. It's not really enjoyable to make music now. -People enjoy it-- -Why do you say that? It takes a lot of time. It takes a lot of practice. You need to get really good at an instrument or really good at a piece of production software. I think the majority of people don't enjoy the majority of the time they spend making music. Okay. First, and this is a hot take, I think a lot of people might actually enjoy making music. It's probably why they were doing it for the 40,000 years of human history prior to AI. But if that is not you and you would rather make music by simply pressing a button, then good news, you don't need AI. There are already a wide variety of toys -made for babies just like you. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) But he is right that AI tools have now reduced the barrier of entry to people who want to produce writing, images, or music that can seem plausibly professional. And even big platforms are now getting in on this. Here's Mark Zuckerberg proudly unveiling a new suite of AI tools for Meta users. We call it Emu for Expressive Media Universe, continuing with our animal theme. -Um... -(SCATTERED CHEERING) And just take a look at these images. Because today we're starting to roll out a bunch of products with this in it. And it's, uh... You know, they're high quality, photorealistic. But, you know, one of the coolest things is that Emu generates them fast. Okay, first, that is just the least charismatic -product demo I've ever seen. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) You think Steve Jobs would be caught dead uttering a dud phrase like ""continuing with our animal theme?"" He'd sooner acknowledge his own children. -(AUDIENCE GASPS, LAUGHS) -But Zuckerberg's obviously trying to make sure Meta capitalizes on the popularity of AI by keeping it within their ecosystem. He said that adding AI images to user feeds is the next ""logical jump"" for Facebook and Instagram. They've even tweaked their algorithm so that more than a third of what people see on their Facebook feed now comes from accounts they don't follow. That's how Slop sneaks in without your permission. So it seems to be good business for them, but what's in it for the people that produce it? Well, platforms like Meta, Twitter, YouTube, and TikTok now have monetization programs where they make direct payments to people who successfully go viral. And there's now a whole industry of AI slop gurus offering to sell you their secrets of how to make profitable slop for a small fee. Remember that cat video from before? Here's its creator trying to sell you a training course. Hey, do you want to go viral and make the same videos as I do? It's really simple. Click the link in my bio, and I'll guide you step by step on how to do it. That class costs 17.99 and will supposedly ""unlock the secrets to crafting viral cat AI videos that capture hearts on TikTok."" And you know who should be pissed off about that more than anyone else? Cats! They've been going viral since the dawn of the internet, and now along comes this sombrero-wearing motherfucker, who isn't even a real cat, by the way, trying to cut them out of the profits. Cats would be so mad about this if they ever gave a single shit about anything humans do. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Now, the good news is you don't need to give your credit card number to an AI cat because I'll give you the three basic steps for free. It's pretty simple. Step one, you make a page on a social media app and build a following. While most platforms require a certain threshold of followers or engagement before they'll pay you, you can easily get around that by buying a pre-existing account, like this one that already has thousands of followers. Then comes step two, create and post as much engagement bait slop as possible. Here is a video by another slop guru showing you just how quickly that can be done. JESSE CUNNINGHAM: So, what we're gonna do, we're gonna type in ""home decor inspiration Pinterest."" Why? Why Pinterest? Because Pinterest is a heavy image-based platform. And what you're going to find as we scroll through these, probably 80 percent of these images are AI generated now. What's so cool is that we can come to this free tool right here, Ideogram, and ask it, “Create a beautiful bedroom design with black curtains and make it hyper-realistic.” You're gonna find that the images, boom, just rendered. And right off the bat for free, we have four images that could do really, really well. Okay, putting aside those photos look like a suicidal West Elm, that is why Pinterest is drowning in AI now and why users like this woman are swearing vengeance -with their indoor voice. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And yet the maker of that video is willing to take 379 dollars from you to teach you more. But it's not just Pinterest photos. Here's another guru explaining how you can buy his proprietary AI tool to make literally every part of a viral video. Let's, for example, do a funny texting story, and then let's go down here and select ""gameplay video."" And let's do Subway Surfers for the background of this one. Click ""generate."" Just like that, our next video is done. Let's take a look at what it looks like. AI GENERATED VOICE: Ever send a text that completely backfired? Let me tell you about my friend Jake. One day, he meant to text his girlfriend, ""Can't wait to see you tonight,"" but instead he accidentally sent it to his boss. His boss replied, ""Uh, I hope this isn't about work."" Panicking, Jake quickly typed back... Yeah, all he did was type ""funny texting story,"" and AI vomited out the rest. Although, to be fair, I don't know if you can call accidentally sending a text a ""great original story,"" as it's one of the four basic plots of any sitcom, along with accidentally scheduled two dates at the same time, roommates divide the apartment in half with tape, and Blues Travelers’ bus broke down outside and now they’re comin’ to dinner! (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Still, as that leather-clad child explained, AI slop is ultimately a volume game, like any form of spam. Slop creators will often jump on a trend that feels like it's got any kind of traction. So if one type of image or video goes viral, they'll churn out hundreds of copycats. That's why suddenly you might start seeing a ton of old people posing with birthday cakes. In that one, it's apparently the hundredth birthday of a woman named Dutndouy. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Similarly, you may have seen images of soldiers holding up signs about how it's their birthday or people posing next to wood carvings of animals with captions like, ""Made it with my own hands."" But interestingly, when internet sleuths traced this AI image, which has nearly a million likes, back to what seems to be its original source, it turned out to be this real image of an actual wood carving created by an artist named Michael Jones. He's apparently based in England and does some amazing work. Look at this carving he did of a horse or this one of whatever the fuck that is. Those are real sculptures he made with a fucking chainsaw. And yet, his work has been stolen and turned into endless variations, and he himself has said getting ripped off by slop is a huge issue for him and other carvers all over the world who are sadly missing out on the rightful credit exposure to their work, which makes sense, and it is a good reminder that AI generators rip off the work of actual artists without compensating them. But assuming that you, as a slop creator, don't give a shit about that, you can simply move on to step three, getting paid. And there are a couple of ways to do this, from being paid directly by the platform, like I mentioned earlier, to other revenue streams based around affiliate marketing or linking to items for sale online. For instance, this slop account on Instagram features a variety of AI videos from world leaders walking the catwalk as babies to videos of animals attacking each other like this elephant absolutely going to town on an alligator. Now, if you go to the bio on that page, you'll see it links to this site selling all sorts of random products that they'll get a commission from if you buy them, from snap-on teeth veneers to this weird duck-shaped pillow for infants, which brags that it's somehow based in research and development for stunned babies... (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...to this, quote, ""Naughty boy creative table lamp whose switch is his tiny dick."" And look, it is wedding season, and if you want to go off registry, that is all the way off. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Now, I'm guessing you can't make a ton of money off that, and honestly, you're unlikely to make a ton from the platforms either, because for all the talk of riches on those slop gurus' videos, the money involved here can be relatively small. On Meta, for instance, one reporter found that payments for single images could vary from just a few cents per photo to hundreds of dollars if it goes mega-viral. And while that clearly isn't enough to live on, it can be more appealing if you live in a country where that kind of money goes further. That is why many slop pages are now operated from places like India, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Pakistan. But there are some real downsides to the unchecked growth of all of this, some of which are admittedly pretty minor. Like the fact that lots of us are now having to explain to our parents that the unbelievable thing that they saw on Facebook is not real. Look at this owl! He's beautiful! It's a Norwegian giant owl. In Norway! SPEAKER 2: Mother. SPEAKER 3: Dude, that's not a real cat. Can you see that? Can you see how, like, soft it is? And it's like-- like... SPEAKER 4: What do you mean it's not a real cat? -That is ridiculously cute. -SPEAKER 5: Mom. How is that real? SPEAKER 5: Mom, that's AI. Is it? SPEAKER 5: That's fake. No fucking way. SPEAKER 5: That's not real. (GASPS) The motherfuckers! -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) -Yeah. The motherfuckers, indeed. And real quick, for anyone watching this, here's a pretty good rule of thumb. If you see an animal that's so cute it defies reality and it is not Moo Deng, odds are it's AI. But we've clearly got bigger problems than people being duped by non-existent animals. There's an environmental impact from the energy and resources consumed in producing all of this shit. And then there's the fact some slop makers specialize in videos that claim to depict real world calamities, which can lead to the spread of worrying misinformation like this. NORA YOUNG: These explosions are fake, but they've racked up millions of views. They've already been shared across social media, including this claim that the explosions are in Ukraine. Before this account disappeared, a reverse image search could take you back to the creator with more videos. And they all have similar issues. See how huge this white car looks? And also, how are these homes still standing with a gigantic fireball behind them? And the audio track is the same in every vid. (REPEAT EXPLOSIONS) So, why make content like this? This creator used to make videos about tornadoes, and before that, about planes on fire, possibly experimenting in the hopes of going viral. Oh, come on. Air travel is scary enough now... (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...without people making up new disasters. It's why you have to be careful and look for clues, like how the side of that plane says nonsense like ""frcananc-faia..."" (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...and not something much more believable like ""Boeing."" -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) -The thing is, sometimes fake videos about news stories can really catch on. During the LA fires, a lot of people were initially fooled by photos and videos like this one of the Hollywood sign engulfed in flames. That was pretty unnerving to LA residents like these two men who went to check it out in person. When we saw the posts on Instagram, we were devastated. We've lived here all our lives, and when we saw that on Instagram, it broke our hearts, so we wanted to come and see firsthand. And, uh... DANNY: We're really shocked that the-- JOHN: There's no fires. DANNY: There's no fires and they're faking it, basically, you know, when people are actually losing their houses. JOHN: You guys should help each other out instead of trying to create false narratives and trying to promote BS. He's right. You shouldn't be faking calamities if for no other reason that you could make those two so worried they trek up to the Hollywood sign... (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...a hike that's a mixed bag even when it isn't on fire, since it has online reviews like, ""Watch out for all the horse poop."" ""There was a lot of horse poop on the floor."" ""This trail stinks because of all the horse poo."" -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) -And my personal favorite, ""You should never hike this trail during a windstorm. (AUDIENCE GROANS) ""I was being hit by flying bits of dried horse poop for about three quarters of a mile before deciding to turn back. -It was something."" -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ""At this point, I decided to abort my hike and ran back to my car. I had bits of dried horse poop stuck in my hair and my sweater. I had a good laugh about it after, but listen to me, children, never hike this trail if it gets too windy. You have been warned."" (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And it's not just the fires. Right now, the Israel-Iran conflict has unleashed a wave of AI disinformation, with one expert saying it's the first time we've seen generative AI be used at scale during a conflict. And during last year's flooding in North Carolina, a bunch of fake images started circulating online, which quickly became a problem for first responders. We saw a flood of images on social media depicting-- and here they are on your screen right now, depicting what appear to be victims in the flood. What happened was the relief workers, also who use social media to, for example, find areas where, you know, people might be getting-- might need rescued like this person rescuing a dog or what looked to be, you know, a toddler being rescued. They use social media just like us to look for areas that need help. And so this was creating a lot of noise, and it was making it more difficult for them to act quickly. Yeah, you don't want emergency personnel allocating resources based on fake information. Although, I will say, if medics are going to rush to the scene of an AI-generated video, for God's sake, make it this one. Somebody send an ambulance to that poor cabbage man. He just tore the top half of his purple head off. He cannot be okay! (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) You may remember that those images were also used by Republicans as evidence that President Biden was failing to deal with the emergency. One member of the Republican National Committee actually posted that photo of the girl with the puppy, captioned, ""This picture has been seeded to my mind. My heart hurts."" But even after being told it was fake, she refused to take it down, writing... “I don't know where this photo came from and honestly, it doesn't matter. It is emblematic of the trauma and pain people are living through.” And it's pretty fucking galling for the same people who spent the past decade screaming ""fake news"" at any headline they didn't like to be confronted with actual fake news and suddenly be extremely open to it. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) You can't just believe something because you saw it in a picture. Otherwise, our graphics team could make you believe any sad situation, like Oscar the Grouch is in the Illuminati. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Or that Bigfoot is having trouble selling his feet pics online. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) -Actually, that is compelling. I don't care where it came from, but it's seared into my heart. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Now, I will say, at least when it came to last year's elections, many experts agree that AI's negative impacts were far less extreme than originally feared. And it is good that large groups of people weren't fooled into thinking that Kamala Harris wore a communist uniform, or that Trump was violently arrested, or that Biden put on a Trump hat. Except, wait, that last one was actually real. He really did that two months before election day. How on earth did Democrats lose? -But... -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...even if people treated fake images last year with skepticism, there are two catches. First, AI is already significantly better now than it was then, so it may be easier to fool them going forward. And second, the very fact people doubted what they saw on the internet actually comes with a bit of a downside, as this disinformation researcher explains. Because people know that something might be a deepfake, they actually then stop believing in real things that actually did happen. And they kind of discount a true story because they're able to tell themselves, ""Oh, I think that might be a deepfake actually."" Right. It's not just that we can get fooled by fake stuff. It's that the very existence of it then empowers bad actors to dismiss real videos and images as fake. It's an idea called the ""liar's dividend,"" which I know sounds like an airport spy thriller James Patterson shit out in a weekend. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) But it is a real problem, and you don't have to look far to see people doing this. A lawyer for one of the January 6th defendants argued that the government's evidence was deepfaked, which is an extremely funny thing to say about a coup attempt that was livestreamed. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And just two weeks ago, when Gavin Newsom posted this real photo of soldiers deployed to LA sleeping on the floor, the conspiracy theorist, Laura Loomer, retweeted a claim that it was fake, saying, ""Looks like Gavin Newsom used an AI photo to smear President Trump."" And of course, Trump's done this too. He falsely claimed photos of Kamala Harris greeting a large crowd were AI-generated. And when Democrats cut together videos of him having ""old man moments,"" he blamed that on AI as well, saying, ""Artificial intelligence was used by them against me in their videos of me,"" which actually might be the most AI-generated sounding sentence -in this entire piece. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) So, to summarize, AI slop can be somewhat lucrative for its creators, massively lucrative for the platforms that use it to drive engagement, and worryingly corrosive to the general concept of objective reality. And now, I've shown you a simple three-step process on how to make it. But, you know, please don't. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Especially given I just saved you from paying 17.99 to a cat in a sombrero. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) -So, what can we do? Well, the truth is, not a lot. Some platforms have started labelling AI content, but even those attempts have been lackluster. Meta, for instance, recently started requiring an AI label when content is realistic, but notably that only applies to audio and video, not to images. And if creators don't actively add those labels, it can be hard for a platform to detect AI as it's getting increasingly hard to spot. On an individual level, if you're sick of all the slop in your feed, you can block accounts that post it or click ""not interested,"" which might reduce the amount of it that you see, but that's not going to stop it all. And look, I'm not saying some of this stuff isn't fun to watch. What I am saying is some of it's potentially very dangerous. And even when it isn't, the technology that makes it possible only works because it trains on the work of actual artists. So any enjoyment you might get from weird, funny AI slop tends to be undercut when you know that someone's hard work was stolen in order to create it. So I don't have a big fix for all of this, or indeed any of it. What I do have, though, is a petty way to respond. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) -Because perhaps one small way to get back at all the AI slop ripping off artists would be to create real art by ripping off AI slop. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) -So please, come with me. Come with me, because... (AUDIENCE CHEERS, APPLAUDS) ...we managed to track down Michael Jones, the chainsaw artist, and we commissioned a special piece from him, ripping off what I consider to be the finest, most inexplicable piece of slop produced to date. So, ladies and gentlemen, I proudly present, from the chainsaw of Michael Jones, a carved manifestation of... the Cabbage Hunk! (AUDIENCE CHEERS, APPLAUDS) Look at him, in all his muscular cabbage glory. Look at the details there. This thing is an absolute masterpiece. And seeing this, does it make you want to thank the real artist who made it? Well, I've got some great news for you. You can do that because we flew him here, too. Michael is here! (AUDIENCE CHEERS, APPLAUDS) Michael Jones, everyone! Michael Jones! Thanks so much, mate. Fantastic. What a fun way to celebrate the destruction of our shared objective reality. We are fucked! That is our show. Thank you so much for watching. We'll see you next week. Good night. Michael Jones! (AUDIENCE CHEERS, APPLAUDS) Michael Jones! ♪ (RESOLUTE MUSIC PLAYING) ♪ ♪ (MUSIC ENDS) ♪"
89R9ZxKaIOw,Tipping: Last Week Tonight with John Oliver (HBO),LastWeekTonight,Political Commentary (Left),20250303,1495,6664444,149008,"♪ (THEME MUSIC PLAYS) ♪ Our main story tonight concerns restaurants. One of the dumbest things we've used HBO's money to pay for, tied with Russell Crowe's jockstrap, this giant cake, and the contractual day rate of Armie Hammer. Three days plus transportation, by the way. There's not a lot to say. More broadly, we're gonna talk about tipping. Lately, we're not just seeing it in restaurants, we're being asked to do it everywhere, and people are fed up. I'm purchasing an office chair online. And they're asking me if I want to leave a tip. Are we tipping... at drive-thrus? The airport in New Jersey just asked me to tip at self-checkout. Tip myself? I did all the work. Who am I tipping? We got fro-yo last night, and it was serve yourself. Then when I go to pay, the kid at the register is like, ""It's just gonna ask you a question."" And the question says, ""How much tip do you want to leave?"" I was like, ""What the fuck am I tipping you for?"" It was literally serve yourself. I grabbed the container. I pulled that lever. I even sprinkled the cookie dough bites. If anybody should be getting a tip around here, it's me. Okay, okay. First, no one should ever be getting that worked up about frozen yogurt. It is ice cream for people who hate themselves. That said, I do agree that you should be able to tip yourself when you do a good job. In fact, I'm going to start something tonight. I'm putting a little bit of money into this jar every time I make a good joke or a salient point. Watch this space. The point is, people are furious at how often they're seeing the tip screen. It is now the least welcome way to encounter an iPad in public outside of guy watching Pornhub on the bus. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) (AUDIENCE LAUGHS, CHEERS) In fact-- In fact, nearly three in four people think tipping culture has gotten out of control. There are so many stories of people being asked to tip in weird places, from one woman saying her mortgage company has been asking for tips lately, to another sharing how her Chevy Cruze got towed, and she went to the impound lot and it came time to pay, on the screen, additional gratuity options appeared. And getting asked to tip at an impound lot might seem like the craziest possible example, until you see this TikTok of a fully automated coffee kiosk. CUSTOMER: You want a fucking tip? Are you serious? You do? I think we can all agree that is ridiculous, especially because that piece of machinery with googly eyes doesn't want a tip. All it wants is the sweet release of death and to be welcomed into the kingdom of heaven. But newsflash, robot, that's never going to happen. You're not getting into heaven. You know why. Say it with me, folks. ALL: You were never baptized. Exactly. Bingo, bango, enjoy robot hell. Down you go and stay there. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) The point is, you're not wrong for thinking tip requests are showing up in more places. But as frustrating as that can be, lots of people depend on tips for their livelihood. And this subject took center stage last year when Trump made this bold promise. I will eliminate taxes on tips for restaurant workers and hospitality workers and anyone else relying on tips. No more taxes on tips. No taxes on tips. None. None. Look, Trump may be the most predictable man who has ever lived, but at least he's out there trying to generate suspense at random points in the middle of otherwise normal sentences. Tips! Once every three or four minutes, he belts out a random word like he's announcing it as the musical guest on Saturday Night Live. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) But it is true, Trump has promised to eliminate taxes on tips, and Kamala Harris followed suit, adopting a similar proposal. And right now, lawmakers are deciding whether or not this proposal will make it into the budget. But the thing is, tipping's actually a lot more complicated and fraught than you may realize. So given that, tonight, let's talk about tipping. Why we do it, what the problems with it are, and how we might be able to address at least some of them. And let's start with the fact that tipping here is way more pervasive than in most of the world. In Europe, tipping is much less of a norm, while in Japan, it can even be considered embarrassing and awkward. And Americans traveling abroad sometimes do find waitstaff confused if they try and tip, as this man discovered in Amsterdam. DAN MCCLUSKEY: We got a few beers, and I left, like, a five on the table, like, ""Oh, you forgot this."" I'm like, ""Oh, no, that's for you."" They're like, ""Why?"" And you know if they ask why, it means they're probably getting paid fine. And they didn't see that and go, ""Oh, yeah."" Like, if you saw somebody in Portland and a five was on a table and they didn't know why, they'd be like, ""All right, five bucks."" That tells you something about the culture of your economy and how you treat your workers. Right, you know a country is in pretty good shape when their workers turn down free money. ""We do not need your five dollars, for we are each given a fair wage and universal healthcare and a beautiful windmill to sleep in at night and all of the tulips that we can eat. Truly, it is paradise here, no?"" (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) But while it is now mainly known as an American affectation, the origin of tipping is commonly traced back to Tudor England, when visitors to private homes were expected to give sums of money at the end of a visit for service rendered by the host's servants. Hundreds of years later, visiting Americans brought the custom back home with them, and it really took off after the Civil War, when some employers hired formerly enslaved people, paid them low wages, and then encouraged customers to leave tips. And I will say, there's consistently been pushback against this practice. William Howard Taft was once referred to as the patron saint of the anti-tip crusaders, which is a fantastic spin on ""cheap bastard."" While Ralph Waldo Emerson complained about tipping for bad service, writing, ""I confess with shame that I sometimes succumb and give the dollar, yet it is a wicked dollar which by and by I shall have the manhood to withhold."" -And while... -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...while it is fine to wish you'll one day be strong enough to resist pressure to tip, I'm just gonna say it, that guy would have absolutely crumbled in the face of this robot. He'd have signed his house over to that googly-eyed monster, even if it got his order wrong. The anti-tipping movement grew so pervasive in the early 20th century, six states passed laws criminalizing the practice, but that obviously did not last. And nowadays, tipping is everywhere. Though it can seem like no one really understands the rules of when and how much to tip. Even one of the leading academic experts on tipping has said, ""I don't know how much you're supposed to tip, and I study this."" It's got to the point where some consumers are now opting out of the system altogether, like this guy. So I'm not tipping anymore. I'm done. I'm out. It used to be you would give a tip if somebody gave exceptional service. When was the last time you got exceptional service anywhere? They made food. You carried it to my table. You got me a Diet Coke. Thank you. That was your job. You don't get 25 percent because you did your job. And I'm not the bad guy here. I'm not. Yeah, are you a hundred percent sure about that, though? Because you can be irritated with our current system of tipping, but protesting it by stiffing your server is about as effective as protesting police budgets by flipping off a police dog. He has nothing to do with the policy, and the only one whose life you're making worse is his. Also, between advocating for stiffing waiters and his ""I Heart Fossil Fuels"" t-shirt, I'm just gonna take a stab here, you might actually be the bad guy. But to understand why just not tipping is such a bad idea, it helps to understand exactly who works for tips and how they get paid. Because while you might primarily think of servers at restaurants, who do make up a large share of those who work for tips, tipped workers can also include casino dealers, doormen, golf caddies, hotel maids, and taxi drivers, among other occupations. In fact, under federal law, workers can be classified as tipped workers if they receive just 30 dollars a month in tips. And that distinction really matters. Because in most states, employers can legally pay tipped workers a much lower base wage, as these cartoon graphics will explain. NARRATOR: Here's how it works. The federal minimum wage is seven dollars and 25 cents per hour. But if you're a tipped worker, it's two dollars and 13 cents per hour, also referred to as the subminimum wage. Yeah, the federal subminimum wage, sometimes called the tipped minimum wage, is just 2.13 an hour. And it's been at that level since 1991. It may be the most depressing thing that we're still having to live with from that year, were it not the exact same year that the Supreme Court was joined by this fucking guy here. The motor coach offer is off the table, by the way. Big mistake. Huge. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Now, for what it's worth, many states choose to set a wage higher than that, but only these seven and a handful of cities have the same minimum wage for tipped and non-tipped workers alike, meaning everywhere else, the expectation is that some workers can be paid less because their tips will make up the difference. But the thing is, two dollars and thirteen cents sometimes isn't even enough to cover payroll taxes, as this worker explains. In Indiana, you make 2.13 an hour. -2.13 an hour? -NIKKI BOOKS: Yeah. ADAM YAMAGUCHI: That's... You don't see a paycheck. Your paycheck literally says, ""This is not a check."" It says, ""Zero dollars. This is not a check."" Because it just goes to taxes? Mm-hmm. So, basically, you're starting at zero. Right. You can literally be given a check that has, ""This is not a check"" written on it. And come on, who is writing those paychecks? René Magritte? ""Ceci n'est pas une paycheck, Magritte?"" Hi, if you're seeing this, you have ""explained the joke to me"" toggled on your HBO account. René Magritte was a Belgian surrealist painter whose most famous works include this painting of a pipe with the words, ""This is not a pipe"" beneath it. Because of course, it isn't a pipe, it's a painting. That might seem banal now, but trust me, if you were sitting at a French art museum in 1929, shit like this blew your fucking dome. People were speaking in tongues, throwing up in response. It was a regular “Rite of Spring” scene. Ah, you hit the button again, huh? ""Rite of Spring"" is a work by Igor Stravinsky that was supposedly so avant-garde, it caused riots at its first performance. Apparently, Camille Saint-Saëns stormed out of the premiere, although, admittedly, that claim is now in some dispute. Now, if you'll excuse me, I really do need to get back to the show. Takes some fucking balls there, right? The point is, you can make as little as two dollars 13 cents an hour. And if what you make up in tips doesn't get you all the way up to minimum wage, theoretically, your employer is supposed to cover the difference through what is called the tip credit. But that can be hard for employers to keep track of, and it's a system that's easy to cheat. It's been said that the tip credit is often abused at the employee's expense, with one restaurant worker saying, ""As long as I've been doing this, I have never, ever, not one time, met anyone that's been compensated for a below-minimum pay period. So the fact is, a lot of tipped workers' pay may come down to how much someone chooses to leave as gratuity. And if you've ever worked, if you've ever in your life worked for tips, you know you can do very well, though that can depend on not just where you work, but when you work, or even what mood your customers happen to be in, as this former hospitality worker explains. If you come in on a Tuesday, I mean, some people party on a Tuesday, but not as much as Saturday. Put yourself in a tip worker's shoes. Could you survive off of two dollars and 50 cents an hour and rely on the drunk guy in front of you to pay your rent? Right, someone's ability to pay their rent can be dependent on a person who may be drunk or partying on a Tuesday, or if they happen to be the current defense secretary, very likely both. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And all this might help explain why recent analyses have found that poverty rates for tipped workers are over twice as high as for non-tipped workers. And some tend to be more disadvantaged by this than others. Studies have found that both Black and White consumers tip White servers more than Black ones. And one paper found that waitresses in their 30s and those with large breasts, blonde hair, and/or slender bodies received larger average tips than their counterparts without these characteristics. And look, it is not news that life is somewhat easier for attractive people. I would know. I was featured in Vogue in 2015 in the gallery titled, and this is true, ""10 Unconventional Alternatives to the Sexiest Man Alive."" It was, at the time by the way, David Beckham. (AUDIENCE CHEERS) Life is just different for us, you know, whether you're the sexiest man alive or his, quote, ""unconventional alternative."" (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) But obviously, those higher tips can come with a lot of unwanted harassment. And if servers are making a subminimum wage, they might feel especially pressured to put up with that in order to make a living. And there is one final twist here, which is that a server's tips may not even be entirely theirs either. In some restaurants, there's an expectation that servers will tip out, or pay a share of their tips to other restaurant personnel. And depending on how that's set up, it can really put servers in a bind. Here's that woman you saw a minute ago explaining how it worked for her. You have to tip out. I mean, most restaurants, it's roughly three to five percent of your sales. So even if people are tipping the 20 percent that is standard for great service, most servers are tipping out three to five percent of that to bussers, hosts, and bartenders. What if I leave you nothing? What happens? Then we have to pay that tip out whether you give us money or not. So like say your bill is a hundred dollars and I have to tip out five percent and you don't tip me at all, I'm paying five dollars to wait on you. Out of my own pocket. That is true. At some places, not only are you subsidizing the servers, they may be subsidizing other members of staff too. And if that seems less like a business and more like an insane money carousel where everyone is paying everyone else and somehow everyone is still poor, welcome to the restaurant industry. At this point, you might be thinking, ""Well, fuck this whole system. Why don't we just get rid of it?"" And you would not be the first to suggest that. Here's that guy you saw earlier gaming out the system that he'd rather see. If you own a restaurant, just tell me what it costs. I don't want people to go hungry. What does it cost for me to get my food and also so that the wait staff doesn't have to join the cartel, do some Lord of the Flies, Oliver Twist. Like, I want people to be taken care of. Just tell me what it costs. Now, that might sound reasonable, the paying fair price for what I'm getting part, not the absolute avalanche of fearing the waitstaff would join the cartel or do some Lord of the Flies or Oliver Twist-like thing, -whatever the fuck that could mean. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) I don't know what versions of either of those books he's read, but Lord of the Flies and Oliver Twist had some very different answers for what children will get up to -when unsupervised. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And neither of them seemed like they'd apply to workers making the tips minimum wage. But unfortunately, when many people say, ""Just tell me what it costs,"" they also mean, ""And it better cost exactly the same or I am going to be pissed."" As this tipping expert explains. I've done the research where I give people hypothetical menus. One where they have regular prices and at the bottom it says, ""A customary tip of 15 to 20 percent is appreciated."" One where they say, ""Tipping is not allowed."" You can't tip, but their menu prices are fifteen percent higher. MADELINE MARSHALL: He then asked people how expensive they thought the restaurant was. People overwhelmingly thought the menu with the 15 percent higher prices was more expensive than a menu where they would tip 15 percent or more anyway. Yeah, even if the amount of money coming out of your pocket is the exact same both times, people view the menu with the built-in tip prices as more expensive, because it just feels more expensive. It's sort of the same way that it feels like I'm older than David Beckham, even though, fun fact, I'm two years younger than him. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) He is aging incredibly, and I think I'm pickling. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) (AUDIENCE CHEERS) I deserve that. (AUDIENCE APPLAUDS) And that has led people to try and come up with other ways to relieve the financial stress on tipped workers, which brings us all the way back to Trump's promise to eliminate taxes on tips. It's an idea that he was proud to reveal had a notable celebrity backer. On your receipt... When you get your receipt for a restaurant-- You know who sent me one? Kid Rock. How good is Kid Rock? Isn't he great, that guy? But he sent me a receipt. And he wrote on the receipt, ""Vote for Trump and you won't pay taxes on tips."" He wrote that on the receipt. I said, ""That's very smart. That's very smart. Smart guy."" So for restaurant workers, for hotel workers, for caddies, for car people... (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) It's a lot, but anybody receiving tips, there's no more tax on tips, and I think that's going to be a great thing. Okay, there is so much to deal with there, from the phrase ""car people"" to, again, the surprise punctuation on ""caddies""... (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...to the fact the president is taking policy advice from Kid Rock, a man who constantly looks like he's on trial for something called moonshine fraud. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) But the thing is, that idea has broad support. It's a proposal supported by roughly three in four Republicans, Democrats, and Independents. And look, I'm all for giving a tax break to low-wage workers, but you should know a lot of economists have major concerns with this particular policy. Starting with the fact that the tax relief it gives, it would be haphazard at best. VANESSA WILLIAMSON: One of the ways to make taxes fair is to make sure that people of the same income level are paying approximately the same amount of taxes. And in this case, you really wouldn't be doing that. So, for example, if you took a delivery worker who delivered food, they'd probably get tips, and so they would qualify for this tax benefit. If you took a delivery worker who delivered packages, they usually don't, so they wouldn't get a tax benefit. But I can't think of a good reason why you would want to give a tax break to the person who delivers food but not to the person who delivers mail. Right, that doesn't make much sense, does it? If someone delivering packages for Amazon makes the same as someone delivering food for DoorDash, it doesn't feel fair for one of them to be taxed significantly more. Though, if we're going to be even fairer, we'd probably tax the guy who owns the company that sends out those packages -a fuckton more as well. -(AUDIENCE CHEERS) But that's not what we're talking about tonight. The point is, Trump's plan would essentially be a tax break for only the two and a half percent of American workers who work for tips, and not even all of those, given that more than a third of tipped workers had incomes low enough that they face no federal income tax to begin with. And that's not the only issue with this idea, it's also a policy that could be exploited. For instance, people with higher incomes might find ways to designate some of their wages as tips to avoid paying taxes. And there have been concerns that it could push some employers to restructure their pay to lean more heavily on tips, meaning prompts to tip could start showing up in whole new categories of consumer transactions. So you might actually be prompted to tip even more than you are right now. The point is, while ""no tax on tips"" is an easy applause line at rallies, it wouldn't be nearly as effective as it sounds. If you really want to give relief to tipped workers, I'd argue the solution would be to eliminate the subminimum wage. Basically, everyone gets at least the minimum wage and then your tip goes on top of that. It's a proposal that this advocacy group has been pushing for nationwide. But I will acknowledge not everyone is on board with this idea. In Michigan, there's been an ongoing fight over raising its subminimum wage, and even some who might stand to benefit do have concerns. JACQUELINE FRANCIS: Andrea Souther works hard for her tips. That's what keeps my lights on. That's what keeps me going back, for sure. JACQUELINE: Because she makes tips, her minimum wage is about four dollars an hour. Soon, that'll change, and she'll make minimum wage like any other worker, which right now is roughly ten dollars an hour in Michigan. When people start to realize you're making hourly, they'll tip less. They'll be like, ""Well, they're already making their minimum wage, which is ten-something an hour."" Yeah, I could see worrying about that. And while I'm not saying it's the only reason she feels that way, having what seems to be her boss -standing three feet away... -(AUDIENCE LAUGHING) ...staring daggers at the camera might also have something to do with it. But I do get those concerns, although it is worth remembering there are seven states that haven't had a subminimum wage for decades, and people still tip there. In fact, one study found that tipped workers in those states typically earn ten to 20 percent more in wages and tips. And I'm not saying switching over is easy. There are good-faith concerns from restaurant owners who are often having to operate on very thin margins about what sudden pay hikes could mean. That's why, in many places where the subminimum wage has been eliminated, it's been done gradually so that restaurants can figure out an approach that works for them, like adding a service charge or raising prices slowly. And it's worth knowing where it's been done, the restaurant industry hasn't imploded. Flagstaff, Arizona has been incrementally doing away with its subminimum wage since 2017, and both restaurant employment and the number of restaurants in its county have risen. Meanwhile, Washington, D.C. is now two years into its phase out, so it's still too early to know the full impact, but numbers currently don't show any obvious problems on the jobs front. There are somewhat fewer bartenders, an increase in waiters and waitresses, and earnings that are broadly consistent with recent years. But maybe the clearest expression of the difference eliminating the subminimum wage can make is looking at states that have done it and the neighboring states that haven't. Just watch as a waitress in Wisconsin, which has a subminimum wage for tipped workers, is asked about Minnesota, which got rid of it. What if someone said to you, ""Wow, we're gonna be just like your neighbors over there in Minnesota, and you're going to get minimum wage as your base salary, plus your tips."" I would love that. (CHUCKLES) I actually know some people who, um, used to work in Minnesota as a server, and then they came over here, and they realized that they're only making 2.33, and they're like, ""I'm literally losing thousands of dollars by coming over here into Wisconsin."" That's not great. You shouldn't lose thousands of dollars just because you're in Wisconsin. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Especially because those dollars are actually more useful there, because Wisconsin is where the National Mustard Museum is. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) -And it has everything. It sells membership to a Mustard of the Month club and this excellent Poupon U sweatshirt. -That's the kind of thing you want some extra cash for. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) So when you take all of this together, a few things are clear about tipping. First, it's unlikely to ever go away completely. At this point, it's just too culturally ingrained no matter what happens. Second, it just isn't the gratuity that many seem to think it is. In fact, in a lot of places right now, it's an absolute necessity. So if you're eating at a restaurant, you have to tip. And there are other jobs where that might also be the case, up to and including car people and... (EMPHASIZES) caddies. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) -Now, does that mean you should also be tipping at an impound lot? No, absolutely not. Should you be tipping this robot? Fuck no! That shouldn't happen under any circumstances. That robot should go to hell and it will. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) But if you didn't know that workers in most states rely on tips to make up for subminimum wages, now you do. And if you'd rather a tip be just a little bonus instead of critical to someone's survival, that's great. That means you support eliminating the subminimum wage. And you should feel free to yell at your state and federal lawmakers about it. But if you're considering withholding tips to prove some kind of point about the unfairness of the industry, I hate to say it, -you might be the bad guy. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Anyway, that is the end of this story, and it's the end of this episode. For those of you at home, your screen's just going to ask you a question real quick. Just go ahead and tap to make your selection. -No pressure, but we worked pretty hard. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS, APPLAUDS) And if you fell asleep but there is a cat that's still awake in your home, just mash your little paws at the screen. D-- Daddy wants some money. That's our show. -Thanks so much for watching. -(AUDIENCE CHEERS) We'll see you next week. Good night. Not 15. Over here. We'll take the 25, please. We worked hard this week. Get it. Get it. Get it. Get it, cat. Twenty-five. Twenty-five. -Get it. -(CHEERING CONTINUES) Get it. (FIRE CRACKLING) (DEMONIC VOICE)"
5Hpgu7wSUQQ,ICE Detention: Last Week Tonight with John Oliver (HBO),LastWeekTonight,Political Commentary (Left),20250310,1459,5758631,110614,"♪ (""LAST WEEK TONIGHT"" THEME MUSIC PLAYING) ♪ Our main story tonight concerns immigration, The surprising subject  of the White House's actual Valentine's Day tweet, which read, ""Roses are red, violets are blue, come here illegally and we'll deport you."" Though I guess that's exactly the kind of romance you'd expect from a house occupied by this loving couple. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Since Trump took office, he's made a big show of having ICE conduct immigration raids, often with news cameras and even Dr. Phil tagging along to try and generate positive coverage, though it hasn't always  gone well. For instance, they raided  apartment complexes in Colorado that were supposedly centers of gang activity, only to return with very few arrests  and some humiliating footage. REPORTER: As the team went door-to-door, they found blood-stained walls, but no gang members. The entire complex was virtually empty. At a second Tren de Aragua-linked complex, ICE was met by activists who taunted them. ACTIVIST: Excellent. -We all need more of that woman's energy. -(AUDIENCE CHEERING) I don't know what she has  in that mug, but I do know what she doesn't have. Any fucks left to give. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) These raids are in fulfillment of Trump's campaign promise to implement the largest deportation operation in American history. And to do that, it seems every week he devises a new place to send migrants, from Costa Rica  to Panama to even this. KRISTINE FRAZAO: The latest piece of the mass deportation puzzle bringing as many as 30,000 criminal migrants to the Navy base at Guantanamo Bay. So we're going to send them out  to Guantanamo. This will double our capacity immediately, right? And tough-- That's a tough-- That's a tough place to get out of. I mean, yeah, it is. Although calling GITMO ""a tough place to get out of"" is a bit of an understatement. A corn maze is a tough place -to get out of. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) A low-hanging hammock -is tough to get out of. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) GITMO is a legal black hole where the Constitution goes to die. Last month, Trump actually flew 178 Venezuelan migrants there, only to quickly reverse course and fly them out after the administration started facing lawsuits. And look, most experts agree that for both legal and logistical reasons, GITMO is unlikely to house 30,000 migrants anytime soon. And what that means is most of the people who get arrested are gonna be funneled into our existing immigration detention facilities. And I know we've talked  on this show a lot about our immigration systems problems before, from the fact our immigration courts are arbitrary and incredibly slow, to the many holes in our asylum process, to the truth that for many, there is no way to ""come in the right way,"" to the failures of Joe Biden's immigration policies and the cruelty of Trump's. But tonight, we're going  to focus very narrowly on detention centers. They don't tend  to get talked about much, despite the fact a lot of people go through them. ICE currently has the budget to hold just over 41,000 people on any given day. And last year, more than 260,000 people cycled through ICE detention in total. But Trump is already talking about sending even more people into that system, which in some quarters is cause for celebration. After the election, stock prices  for private prison companies like Geo Group and CoreCivic soared, with their CEOs  each bragging to investors about how much money  they were going to make. Look, as a general rule,  if something happens that causes  a private prison company to get really excited,  that thing was bad. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) If you ever come home and your spouse tells you, ""Honey, I did something today and the GEO Group -is super excited about it..."" -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...you are in for a relationship altering conversation. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And the thing is, immigration detention facilities are by law not supposed to be a punishment. ICE's own website even states that ""Detention is non-punitive."" Though as you're about to see, that's like claiming that the ocean is not wet or that the Wicked movie wasn't 30 minutes too long. -It is a bold assertion... -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...sharply undercut by empirical evidence. So given all of that, tonight, let's talk about ICE detention facilities and try and answer  a few basic questions. Who's in them? Who runs them? And what's it actually like inside them? And let's start with who's getting sent there. Trump and those around him often try and sell their immigration roundups as being about cracking down on crime. Here's his press secretary  answering a question about exactly who was arrested in the first round of ICE raids. Of the 3,500 arrests ICE has made so far since President Trump came back into office, can you just tell us the numbers? How many have a criminal record versus those who are just in the country illegally? All of them because they illegally broke our nation's laws, and therefore they are criminals as far as this administration goes. I know the last administration didn't see it that way, so it's a big culture shift in our nation to view someone who breaks our immigration laws as a criminal, but that's exactly what they are. Well, hold on, because that  is not actually true. While entering the US without authorization can be a criminal offense, many of those who are undocumented entered legally and overstayed their visas. And simply being undocumented is a civil violation, not a criminal one. That is an important distinction that her boss should frankly understand, given that he has committed both. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) -And to be clear, more than 50 percent of those in ICE detention have no criminal records, and many more have only minor offenses, including traffic violations. What's more, a lot of them are already in the asylum process. As of last year, almost half of those in ICE custody were seeking asylum, and that is actually true of some of those who got scooped up in Colorado last month. One man got detained even though he'd done everything he was supposed to do. He'd committed no crimes and had an asylum hearing court date. And yet, despite that, listen to his brother  describe what happened. ANGELINE MCCALL: On Wednesday, Luis' brother, Jhonthan, was driving him to work. -ICE MEMBER: No ID though? -ICE MEMBER 2: ID. ANGELINE: They didn't get past the parking lot at the Cedar Run apartment complex, where ICE detained  at least five people as part of a raid Wednesday. (SPEAKING IN SPANISH) TRANSLATOR: They asked us for documents from here. We showed them the asylum processes, the form the court stamped for us. ANGELINE: Luis says officers wouldn't accept his brother's paperwork, even though he showed his asylum documents as he waits on a work permit. He has so many questions about how his brother was detained without a criminal record. TRANSLATOR: If he doesn't have a deportation order, how can they take him? Yeah, that's a good question. It's actually one of many things  I find hard to understand about watching that, including why those agents were wearing -camouflage while doing it. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) You're in a parking lot,  not dense foliage. If you actually wanted to blend in, you should have dressed up  like a Claire's Accessories -in a strip mall. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) The thing is, holding someone in detention is only meant to be done in limited circumstances, like if they're a flight risk or to make sure they show up for an immigration hearing. But the vast majority do show up for those hearings because they want their case heard. And for those  with asylum claims, like that guy's brother, a recent study found that of those who weren't detained, 95 percent attended all of their immigration court hearings. Now, there are some immigrants  who are subject to what's called ""mandatory detention,"" like if they've been accused of breaking the law. That used to be confined  to serious offences like murder or gun trafficking, but that all changed when Bill Clinton expanded it to also cover minor crimes,  from low-level drug convictions to writing a bad check. And those convictions don't even have to be recent. Take this man who was brought from Jamaica to the US by his family  when he was a teenager. He served in the military, but after completing his service, pled guilty to marijuana possession in 1997. He moved on, started a business  and a family. But then in 2010, this suddenly happened. About 5:30 in the morning, I heard a big knock  on the door. Boom, boom, boom, boom,  boom, boom, boom, boom. And I opened the door. And then they was like, ""Did you apply for citizenship like six months ago?"" I'm like, ""Yeah."" And they was like, “Turn around, that's why we're here.” I didn't think that in 2010 that the marijuana conviction that happened 14 years ago would have came back and haunt me. That is ridiculous. Clearly, no one should be  punished for a minor mistake they made 14 years earlier. Otherwise, I'd have hell to pay  for playing Vanity Smurf in the 2011 Smurfs movie. I was already punished when I saw it, and again when I had to pose for this press photo. -I think I've suffered enough. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) The point is that Clinton-era expansion supercharged  the detainee population, which passed 20,000 in 2001, only to expand  through Bush, Obama, Trump and Biden to the point where we now have the world's largest immigration detention system, which should be a massive embarrassment. Because America has the world's largest of a lot of things, and they're mostly either awesome or, at worst, fantastically weird. We have the world's largest paint can, the world's largest office chair, and my personal favorite, the world's largest basket. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) -It is seven stories tall, not including the handles. And fun fact, it doubled  as the headquarters for Longaberger, a basket manufacturing company in Ohio, and was apparently  the brainchild of the company's founder, who wrote in his memoir, ""I figured if Walt Disney could build an empire around a mouse, the Longaberger home office building -could resemble a basket."" -(AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Adding, ""Whenever I talked about it, people looked at me like I was nuts."" (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Sadly, the company vacated the basket in 2016, and it's been abandoned ever since, though you can find  videos online of admirers who've made pilgrimages to see it since then, like this one. VLOGGER: I don't think the pictures are doing it justice. This looks way, way bigger in person and than when I was seeing it in photos for a very long time. And here I am in the shadow. of a seven-story basket. More companies need to do this. Build their offices and headquarters in oversized buildings shaped like their products. I could not  agree more with that. I've been saying  the same thing for years. There is nothing I want more  than for General Mills to be housed inside of a giant Cheerio, or for L'Oreal to be housed inside of a giant lipstick, or McDonald's to be housed inside of a giant ice cream machine that's always out of service. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) All that said,  I'd argue being home to the empty, decaying carcass of the world's largest basket office is still significantly less embarrassing than being home to the world's largest immigration detention system. See, I brought it back home  in the end. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) I bet you forgot what I was even talking about, but I knew where I was going with this. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) -I always know sometimes. And while the average length of stay for a person in ICE custody is just over 44 days, that is just an average. There are more than 2,800 people who've been detained from six months to a year, and nearly 700 who've been detained  for longer than that. And that is the thing. If you are sent into detention, you don't know  how long you'll be there. There is no set timetable  for your release. And even some of those in charge of these centers can almost acknowledge the problems with that. It's not like a jail inmate that's in here sentenced to a certain time. They know the day they get out. They have no idea  when they're gonna leave. And I know, I mean,  if I was in their place, it would be very difficult to not know when I'm leaving. You know, people see it sometimes as a punishment. We don't punish. So-- So it's-- I know it's viewed that way, but we aren't gonna hold  somebody to punish them. Okay, but the thing is, being locked up and not knowing when you get to leave is basically the definition of a punishment. Just ask this studio audience right now. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Not only are they stuck here, they have no idea when this is gonna be over. They're just trapped in this room, getting sadder by the minute, wishing this was a taping of Drew. -Sorry, guys. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) She's in the studio next door. There's a cooking demonstration today. They're giving out blenders. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) So, that is who is in these facilities, but where exactly are they? Well, sometimes ICE detains people in local jails, which is already a little weird, given that, again, ICE detention is supposed to be non-punitive, but the vast majority, over 90 percent in fact, are held in facilities owned or operated by private prison companies. That is why those CEOs were so excited on their earnings calls. These companies make a ton of money out of detaining immigrants. In fact, America's very first private prison was built for immigration detention. FRED GRAHAM: American business is becoming bullish on prisons. Firms like the Corrections Corporation of America in Nashville, Tennessee believe there will be no business like jail business in the 1980s. This construction site in Houston, Texas, will soon become the first completely free enterprise prison in the United States designed, built, owned and operated by a business corporation. It is being built for the U.S. Justice Department to detain up to 300 aliens charged with entering this country illegally and awaiting deportation hearings. The market is enormous. There are over a half a million people in this country incarcerated at the present time. Wow. So there is a lot there. The sheer unblinking creepiness of that man alone is a little distracting, as is the weirdly upbeat tone of the rest of the segment. ""No business like jail business"" isn't something you should be saying in a news report. It sounds like a musical where Bernadette Peters shanks someone in their sleep. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And the fact is, business has been good for private prisons ever since. CoreCivic and GEO Group derive respectively 27 and 30 percent of their revenues from contracts for ICE detention alone. And you can see why this is such an appealing model for ICE. They get to outsource the headaches and responsibilities of these facilities, and sometimes ICE even adds another layer of removing by contracting with local governments, who then, in turn, contract with private companies. That is attractive because those particular arrangements are subjected to significantly less scrutiny than is required for ordinary federal contracts. So this system seems to work great for the companies and for ICE, but it works much less well for anyone who needs to go through it. So let's talk about what these facilities are like. And let's start with the fact they're often located in incredibly remote areas. That is actually a big deal, because it means detainees can be cut off from legal representation. Some facilities have only one immigration attorney within a 100-mile radius for every 200 people detained. And because phone calls are often denied or difficult to schedule, lawyers like this one can spend a ridiculous amount of time just trying to get to their clients. So, I leave my house in the mornings, get on the road, typically just try to power all the way through to the detention center. We typically go only to Pine Prairie, and so that's about a three, three-and-a-half-hour drive. Today, we're making the trip up to Jackson for some special cases, and so that's a four-and-a-half-hour, five-hour, depending on traffic, drive. Yeah, that is a big problem, especially given among detained immigrants, those with representation were twice as likely to obtain immigration relief as those without. So lawyers are very important. I know I make fun of them sometimes because lawyer used to be this guy's job, but... (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...without them, we would be fucked. There'd be no Good Wife, no Michael Clayton. There'd definitely be no this show. We'd have been shut down years ago after being sued into oblivion for sexual harassment by Adam Driver. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And that is before you get to the conditions inside these facilities, which can be hard to see as access is so heavily controlled. The glimpses you tend to get are either from heavily managed tours given to local news crews or videos produced by the facilities themselves, like this one about a New Mexico facility owned by a company called MTC. NARRATOR: The Otero facility hosts various sporting tournaments and other activities to keep the men engaged. Just like the Imperial facility, detainees have access to medical and dental care. MTC staff are trained to treat detainees with great respect and dignity. We call it a BIONIC, “believe it or not I care” approach. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Okay. If your starting point to saying, ""I care"" is ""Believe it or not..."" (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...you've already got off on the wrong foot. If I told you, ""Believe it or not, I don't draw erotic fan fiction of the Honey Nut Cheerios bee,"" the very fact I said, ""Believe it or not"" suggests you already assumed that I do. It's an assumption that is already damning on its own, because I don't. He's not really my type, cartoon bumblebee wise. This, for instance, does nothing for me. -(STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) -Nor does this. Not even this one. And for what it's worth, I definitely didn't draw any of these myself, believe it or not. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And while they paint a lovely picture there, the fact is conditions in ICE detention can be brutal. For instance, detainees are often expected to do a lot of the cooking and the cleaning themselves. And while ICE does require the jobs to be paid, the amount is pitifully small. In many places, it's just one dollar a day. And detainees who refuse to work can be threatened with the withholding of food or ""disciplinary segregation,"" also known as solitary confinement. GEO Group was once sued over this at one of its facilities, and in court, made a bold argument that the judge wanted no part of. JAY ROOT: GEO says even if it comes down to choosing between punishment or work, that's still a choice. Listen to this exchange between GEO's lawyer and a judge who questions the company's rationale. Wow, that is not great. When a judge is likening your client's practices to slavery, that's generally a pretty bad sign for your case. There really shouldn't even be a verdict at that point. A trap door should just open up beneath you while they call the next case in. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And that's not the only time detainees have been subjected to solitary. One study found over a five-year period, ICE facilities placed people in solitary 14,000 times, with an average duration of 27 days, well exceeding the 15-day threshold human rights experts have found constitutes torture. And that is not all. ICE itself reported that between 2017 and last year, at least 70 detained migrants died while in its custody. And the details in some of these cases are horrifying. Take Kamyar Samimi. He immigrated from Iran in the '70s and became a lawful permanent resident. In 2005, he pled guilty to possessing less than a gram of cocaine and was sentenced to community service. But twelve years later, ICE suddenly decided his drug conviction rendered him deportable. That's already bad enough, but while he was held in detention, the staff cut him off from the methadone he took to manage his drug addiction completely cold turkey. He started vomiting blood clots, but the staff delayed several more hours before calling 911, and Samimi died just two weeks after entering the facility. And this is how his daughter found out. I got a text from my coworker letting me know that an immigration officer had stopped by my place of work and had left a business card and wanted to speak with me. And he answered the phone and told me that my father had suffered cardiac arrest, that he was taken to a hospital and then he was pronounced dead. My dad died on Saturday and I got the call on Monday. I think it's very strange that ICE observes business hours to tell people that their loved ones are dead. Yes, ""strange"" is definitely one way to describe it. ""A fucking disgrace"" would be another. And incredibly, that story is not even a one-off. One study found that 95 percent of deaths in ICE custody were preventable or possibly preventable if ICE had provided clinically appropriate medical care. One of the cases it cites is a man from Angola who began to demonstrate symptoms of mental illness. He refused to eat meals, losing 30 pounds in about 30 days. At one point, he agreed to drink Ensure, but the staff never provided any because the ICE coordinator responsible was trying to find it at a reasonable or discounted price. That facility, by the way, was the same one in that upbeat video about how, believe it or not, they care. So I guess they mean that phrase in the exact same way Ripley's Believe It or Not! means it. Look, we're completely full of shit. How you feel about it is really up to you. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And if after all of this you're thinking, ""Well, it sure seems like we're doing an incredible amount of damage unnecessarily,"" you are absolutely right. And don't just take that from me. Here is a former director of ICE basically saying the same thing. JOHN SANDWEG: We detain lots of people who are not dangerous and aren't a flight risk. It makes no sense to me. We should ask ourselves a larger question, which is, why are we in this business? What do we get out of this? And it's just the politics of it, right? The politics, the public likes to hear ""detention."" It sounds tough. I mean, that is true. The public does love things that sound tough. It's probably why Mark Sinclair made his stage name Vin Diesel and not Reginald Chugglewums III. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) But when he asked there, ""Why are we in this business?"" the very fact this is a business is part of the answer. And that is a fact not lost on some of those inside these facilities. (SPEAKING IN SPANISH) TRANSLATOR: By keeping us here for seven or eight months, they are making money on us because we are a business for them. Immigration in this country is a business. He's right. Immigration is a business like any other for-profit endeavor in America, whether it's Toxic Rage Circle Jerk, Inc., the Small Business Elimination Omnicompany, or Pottery Barn. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) -I actually don't have anything bad to say about Pottery Barn. They make high-quality home goods at affordable prices. Keep doing what you're doing, Pottery Barn. -But the thing is... -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...everything I've shown you so far has been from before Trump took office for a second time. What comes next will almost certainly be worse. Congress recently expanded mandatory detention even further to cover undocumented people who are charged with any theft-related offense. Trump's also started placing migrants in federal prisons and is reopening facilities that have been forced to shutter amid allegations of unsafe or crowded conditions. So, what do we do? Well, at the federal level, honestly, for the next few years, we're fucked. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS SOFTLY) But some states have found ways to mitigate the harm. Illinois, for instance, barred private companies from contracting with local communities to detain immigrants. It also prohibited cities and counties from contracting with ICE to house or detain immigrants at local jails, which is great. I would argue all states should be doing that. And to its credit, New Mexico is considering a similar proposal right now. Look, Trump's government is clearly going to do everything in its power to act as callously as possible for the next four years. And I know no one wants to hear another heartfelt soliloquy about how this administration's immigration policies fly in the face of America's founding ideals. We are well past that. But moving forward, we're going to have to find ways to push back hard at the state and local level against those determined to score political points at the expense of an incredibly vulnerable population. And to anyone who continues to support that agenda, there is really only one thing to say. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) (AUDIENCE CHEERING, APPLAUDING) Yeah, exactly."

KloahKhSWTk,The Secret Trump Investigation Nobody is Talking About,Johnny Harris,News & Journalism,20240912,1709,4658434,145820,"- We are going to make our country great again. (crowd cheering) - It's January 15th, 2017. In five days, Donald Trump will be sworn in as president of the United States. Thousands of miles away in Cairo, Egypt, at this bank 11 kilometers from the international airport, a bank manager receives a handwritten note from someone who holds an account at the bank. The note asks him to, quote, ""Kindly withdraw a sum of 9,998,000 US dollars."" This was unusual. But according to bank records, bank employees did what they were told, heading to a vault full of US dollars and assembling stacks of $100 bills into two large bags. It all weighed about 200 pounds and comprised a large part of all of the US dollars that were in Egypt at the time now sitting in bags in the manager's office. Until later that day when four men showed up. They verified that they were associated with the account and they took the money, put it into a truck, and left. The bank account where that $10 million was taken out of belonged to a shadowy organization called The Research and Studies Center. It was an Egyptian entity, but it's an entity that US Intelligence believes is a front for the general intelligence services of Egypt. Basically Egypt's international spy agency, the Egyptian CIA, let's say. So the Egyptian CIA takes out $10 million. And from here, the trail goes cold. Because shortly after this transfer of $10 million, the account is closed. And that entity, The Research and Studies Center who owned the account, apparently doesn't exist anymore. Why did the Egyptian CIA need $10 million in cash? Who were these men who collected it? What were they doing, and what, if anything, does this $10 million have to do with former President Donald Trump? This is a really important set of questions, one that the FBI and federal lawyers have been secretly investigating to try to answer for years because they strongly suspected that this $10 million made its way into the hands of the Trump campaign, a foreign country trying to buy the election. And in exchange, buying loyalty from the new president. And they suspected that Trump may have known about this and accepted this bribe. And if he did, that would be a violation of federal law. I wanna tell you this story of this investigation and how it was suddenly shut down by Department of Justice officials who were appointed by Donald Trump. This recently released Washington Post investigation reveals that there was much, much more going on that we didn't know about until just now. So I'm gonna try to visualize this story, show it to you in the clearest way possible. Now listen, I know that this is a very politically sensitive topic. There's an election coming up. We all are taking our sides. I commit to you that I'm going to stick to rock solid facts here. I'm gonna lay them out the best I can and show you the evidence that clearly demonstrates how we know these facts. Whenever I'm making circumstantial connections or my own analysis, I will try to make that very clear. Ultimately, I wanna lay this all out and let you make a decision as to whether you think there was wrongdoing here, whether you think something needs to be changed or someone needs to be held accountable. As always, every assertion in this video is fact checked and linked in my sources by time code. You can always check that out, scrutinize it, leave comments if you have issues with it. And with that, let's dive in. - Today I wrote another check for $10 million. I'm spending money like crazy. President El-Sisi has been somebody that's been very close to me from the first time I met him. I met during the campaign. Where I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn't lose any voters, okay? - Hey, before we go on, I wanna explain something about our methodology of reporting on stories like this. Going deep on stories takes weeks, like, sometimes six or eight or 10 weeks to like really understand these stories. And a tool we've been using more and more is Ground News, who is the sponsor of today's video. Ground News is a website and an app that gathers news from around the world and condenses it into one single article. They'll show you this story and then they'll show you who's covering it, how factual the different sources are, who those sources are owned by, and what political leaning or bent is present in the coverage. All of this happening in one seamless experience both on mobile and desktop. Let me give you an example from this very story. If you type in the Trump Egypt story into Ground News, you can see that more than a dozen news outlets have picked up the story and almost all of the coverage is from the left. Only 13% of the coverage comes from right-leaning publications. And you can see that one left-leaning source claims that democracy will die if the case against Trump is dropped. While a right-leaning source downplays the event as a, quote, ""brief probe."" I mean, there's a ton of bias present in both of these headlines, and Ground News lets you easily see that. There's also this feature called My News Bias, where you can look at your reading habits, the top sources that you're drawn to, how reliable the articles are that you read, and it will help flag blind spots in your information, the stuff that you're either avoiding consciously or unconsciously.

And with that, let's dive back into this story about Donald Trump and Egypt. (pensive music) All right, hold on a sec. I have been using this elementary school penmanship practice paper for about 10 years as my note taking platform. And I don't know why, but I love it. Okay. To keep things totally rock solid, crystal clear, I'm gonna make a list. I'm gonna call this list, What We Know. And in this box, on this list, I am going to put the things that we truly know that are rock solid facts to keep us crystal clear. Number one, we know that Egypt wanted to give money to Donald Trump's campaign. They planned on it, they approved it. How do we know that? The CIA. ""Ah, Johnny Harris talking about the CIA again. Here we go."" The CIA spies on everyone. We know that. We know they spy on foreign countries and foreign leaders. And during the 2016 presidential campaign, we know that they had a confidential informant within the Egyptian government. This was a reliable informant who had given the CIA reliable information in the past. They trusted this person. Between this informant and, quote, ""other operations,"" the CIA learned that, quote, ""Egyptian leaders, including Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, had signed off on sending $10 million to Mr. Trump's cash-trapped campaign."" They say this happened just before the 2016 election. Okay, let's go back to our list here and make this more specific. The CIA is actually saying that they know that the president of Egypt, El-Sisi, actually signed off on giving Donald Trump $10 million, specifically $10 million. We were never supposed to learn about this intel, by the way. This was totally classified, part of a secret investigation. And in my mind this intel is quite reliable. It comes from multiple sources, it comes from a reliable informant. And the CIA used it as a way to pass along to the Department of Justice their concern that there may have been some foreign interference from Egypt. And with that, let's get back to this guy, Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, the president of Egypt. He's a military man who rose to power in 2014 after kicking out Egypt's first democratically-elected president, who by the way was horribly unpopular and the people also kind of wanted to kick him out. But, yeah, he rose the power in a coup and then just held on to power. And predictably, once he consolidated power, he started silencing the press, squashing political dissent or political opponents, locking people up, arresting journalists and activists, et cetera, et cetera. Same old story. But his record was so bad that during the Obama administration, the US cut Egypt off of billions of dollars of military aid that we usually send them. We cut it off to basically punish El-Sisi for all of these horrible human rights abuses. So Egypt gets cut off from all this vital military aid. But not for long. (pensive music) Okay, here's the second thing we know. Trump and El-Sisi met up in New York during the campaign, like when he was still a candidate. It was September, 2016, a few weeks before the election. They're at the UN headquarters. (crowd cheering) And they have this closed door meeting. And according to the Trump campaign, Trump was very warm to El-Sisi. Now remember, the US was keeping Egypt at arms length because of all these human rights abuses. So, like, that was the MO for diplomats. Trump totally breaks from all of that in true Trump fashion. Says that he loves El-Sisi, he's gonna invite him to the White House. The campaign says that the US will be, quote, ""a loyal friend to Egypt."" Here he is on Fox News right after the meeting. - [Donald] He's a fantastic guy. He took control of Egypt and I thought it was a great meeting. We met for a long time, actually. We had a long meeting. - So that's the other thing we know. That's why it's on this list. Trump loves El-Sisi, they have a good chemistry. Trump wants to help Egypt. So it's actually not surprising that Egypt wants to help Trump win. Like, this would be very good for El-Sisi, which explains point number one here. El-Sisi signed off on this plan to give $10 million to Trump according to good CIA intelligence because he wanted him to win. It would benefit him and his regime if Trump won. (pensive music) Now, a little context here, presidential campaigns are really messy and hard in the last few weeks. Campaigns kind of have to spend millions and millions of dollars in like the last two weeks leading up to the election to blitz on advertising, on travel, on like get out the vote campaigns. But the Trump campaign found itself in a tricky situation in the weeks leading up to the 2016 election. They didn't have the money to do this. They were running out. So what did the campaign do? They asked Trump himself for money. This post investigation reveals that they pleaded with Trump to write a check to his campaign for a final blitz of television ads. And the response was, no. ""Trump repeatedly declined."" He didn't wanna give any more of his own money to this campaign. That is until October 28th, 2016. It's five weeks after Trump and El-Sisi met in New York, and Trump suddenly changes his mind and announces that he's going to write a check to his campaign for this final blitz. And how much is he going to give? $10 million. - [Donald] Today I wrote another check for $10 million. I'm spending money like crazy. (crowd cheering) - Now, one small thing here, Trump advisors told the FBI that while this $10 million looked like a contribution, like a donation from Trump to his campaign, they actually structured it as a loan. $10 million that could be paid back to Trump. Okay, so we know that President El-Sisi signed off on giving Trump's campaign $10 million. Why? Because Trump and El-Sisi are friends and a Trump presidency would benefit El-Sisi and his regime greatly. We also know that Trump who refused to give money to his campaign in the final weeks leading up to the election suddenly changed his mind and wrote a check for $10 million to his campaign, which was a loan to be paid back. Okay, I'm gonna add that to the list. Does this all feel solid to everyone? Like, we're... Like, these are rock solid facts in my mind. And now let's just add the point that we talked about at the very beginning, that five days before Trump was inaugurated, $10 million of cash... Or sorry, $9,998,000, two grand away from $10 million, was loaded up in two bags in cash and carted away, taken out of a bank account that is associated with El-Sisi's intelligence agency. I'm gonna add this to the list. So looking at these four items, doesn't it kind of feel obvious? Doesn't your brain want to connect the dots and paint a picture that it feels very clear in my brain? President, El-Sisi, who we know wants to give $10 million to his new friend Donald Trump orders $10 million to be taken out of a bank and secretly transferred to Trump's campaign. And Trump knowing this suddenly feels comfortable loaning his campaign exactly $10 million, knowing that he'd be repaid from this money from Egypt. Doesn't it all lined up? Like, case closed. We can just like convict somebody. No, that's not how it works. That's not how the burden of proof works. It's not how our justice system works. This list, while full of robust facts, still doesn't paint a picture of any wrongdoing. It is in the realm of circumstantial evidence. $10 million over here, $10 million over here, they must connect. But investigators never found the connection. They never found the $10 million flowing in to Trump's bank account. And therefore, this is circumstantial evidence and not rock solid provable anything. But luckily, when we have this, that's what investigations are for. (gentle percussive music) Soon after Trump takes office, the Department of Justice launches an investigation. Because remember, this is when the CIA told them that quote, ""El-Sisi signed off on giving Trump $10 million."" This was concerning intel and it was happening at a time, if you remember, that there was a lot of concern about foreign interference in American democracy. A lot of that focused on Russia. That was public, that was a big thing. We all talked about Russia foreign interference. But at the same time, there was this investigation happening into whether Egypt helped buy the 2016 election. It was all happening quietly in the background because it was pretty sensitive. We're talking about potential bribery of a sitting president. So the FBI and investigators are looking into this, trying to find evidence of potential wrongdoing. Meanwhile, president Trump takes office and starts to do exactly what he kind of promised he would do when it came to Egypt. He invites El-Sisi as one of the first guests to the White House. He calls him, and this is a direct quote from someone who was in the room at the G7 Summit in France. Quote, ""My favorite dictator."" God, Trump. Boy. ""My favorite dictator."" And then remember how Egypt had been cut off by the Obama administration of like $1.4 billion of military aid? Trump unfreezes that money and it starts to flow to El-Sisi, not for anything in return, just give El-Sisi the money. And this was against the advice of his first secretary of state. He said like, ""This is not a good idea."" And Trump's like, ""Yes, it is."" $1.4 billion to Egypt. Now listen, if, big word, ""if."" Put if on the screen. If El-Sisi had bribed Trump with $10 million to help get him elected, then his investment is paying off. He is benefiting a ton from a Trump presidency. Now, we don't know if he did. We don't have any direct evidence that he did. But if he did, pretty good investment. So while this is all happening, the FBI and federal investigators continue to try to find a link. $10 million leaving Egypt. Did it ever enter Donald Trump's bank account somehow? To find this out, they took the investigatory step of requesting Donald Trump's personal bank records. They were gonna look at them to find large transactions to see if $10 million showed up sometime before the election. So let's get a calendar out here. The FBI requested records spanning May to November, 2016, the months leading up to the election. But guess what? They didn't find anything. They found no suspicious deposits from foreign entities of $10 million. So then they decided to go look at the Egyptian bank and get their records and they fought in this massive battle that is wild, and it's detailed in The Post investigation because the Egyptian bank didn't want to give over their records. They're like, ""No, no, no, no, no. We're not gonna give over our records because that would,"" quote, ""wreak havoc on American foreign policy, possibly alienating US allies, undermining diplomatic efforts, and inviting reciprocal treatment."" Geez, what's in these records, Egyptian bank? Like, what is in these records that's gonna topple American foreign policy? So this epic court battle goes down, there's like a secret investigation and court thing happening in DC. It goes all the way to the Supreme Court. And finally, the Egyptian bank has to surrender the records. And this is how we learn about the big transfer in US dollars that happened from the Egyptian bank in cash. They didn't know about this before. But the investigators notice something weird about all of these records that they got from the Egyptian bank, which is that other than that tiny handwritten note that said, ""Put $10 million in two bags and four guys are gonna come pick it up,"" they felt like something was missing. And I'm gonna quote directly from The Post here, just so clear. They found that the bank, quote, ""had not turned over a single email of that enormous same day transaction,"" the $10 million of cash, and ""that the lack of any internal communication on such a huge sum of money, same day transaction, was unthinkable."" The US prosecutor who was heading this case continues with, ""Its strains credulity that the bank kept such a stockpile of US dollars on hand, let alone that it was able to be gathered up in less than 24 hours."" Translation, the bank probably didn't give over all their records. Like, really, there was no other like emails being like, ""Hey, there's gonna be a $10 million transaction from this bank branch near the airport."" So they're probably missing some records, but they did get that handwritten note that talked about the $10 million transfer in cash five days before the inauguration. January 15th, let's get back to the calendar. Now, remember, the FBI had access to Trump's bank records from May to November, 2016. So if the $10 million was going to the Trump campaign, the FBI wouldn't see it because they only had Trump's records up to November, 2016. ""Okay, well, that's easy,"" says the FBI. ""Now that we have new information about this $10 million transfer from Egypt, let's just get a wider set of records from Trump's bank, something after January 15th so that we can see if some $10 million deposit shows up there."" This is like standard investigatory procedure. One FBI agent told The Post that if this were any other investigation, they would have a justification to get these records, quote, ""in a heartbeat."" But because this wasn't any other investigation, this was investigating the finances of a sitting president, they would have to ask their boss for permission. And who is their boss? This guy, Bill Barr. And here's where the investigation starts to deteriorate, unfortunately. (pensive music) Bill Barr was appointed by Donald Trump to be the Attorney General. That's the head of the Department of Justice, the top law enforcer of America. Bill Barr can reasonably be considered a Trump ally. You may disagree with me on this. And if you do, please say so in the comments. I'd love to hear your rebuttal to what I'm about to say. His job is to keep the president legal and honest. And yet, what he showed during his tenure is that he would often side with Trump. He would undermine investigations against him and he even stoked fears of voter fraud in 2020 without real evidence. Though he did eventually come out and affirm that the 2020 election was not stolen because there's no evidence that it was. But, yeah, the guy is a Trump ally. And the big question is, why does the president get to appoint the person who is supposed to keep him legal and honest? The American system is not perfect and there's also other special sort of controls on how we keep the president honest, even if this guy's biased and politically motivated. Anyway, I'm not gonna go into that. That's a story for another day. The point is, Bill Barr, we can say is a Trump ally and he is the boss of all these people who are investigating the Trump-Egypt connection. So he hears about this investigation, he hears that the agents want to expand the amount of bank records that they can get on Trump so that they can see if there was a $10 million deposit after the cash left Egypt. And he doesn't like it. He doesn't like it one bit. He goes to the FBI director and he says, ""Hey, you need to,"" quote, ""impose adult supervision on these agents who are,"" quote, ""hell bent on getting a wider range of Trump's records."" Adult supervision. Yikes. That doesn't sound good. Barr starts voicing doubt about the actual agents who are working on this investigation and starts to question whether or not there's even enough evidence to continue the investigation. Now, a note about the agents. If Bill Barr is politically appointed and potentially marred by political bias, the investigators in this case often are not. They're career employees of the department. They are there because they are good at their job. They have shown that they're committed to the values of justice in America. They've not risen because they have garnered favor with some political person, at least not as much as political appointees. Politics is in everything. It's impossible to escape it. But these career investigators have different incentives. And these career investigators felt strongly that this investigation needed to continue. That they had evidence that the next logical step was to get a wider range of Trump's records so they could see if this $10 million shows up and they are met with more and more resistance by Barr and other Trump appointed leaders within the Department of Justice. This drama, this tension, which was all happening in secret, is now thoroughly documented in this Washington Post investigation. I recommend that you read it because the The Post interviewed like dozens of these people who were in the room, and it paints a picture that is very clear. The political appointees didn't want this to happen. It all comes to an end when Barr kind of suddenly replaces the prosecutor who was working on this case with someone who was more aligned with him. And he almost immediately pumps the brakes on this investigation. He halts it. A few months later, BARR replaces that person with a new prosecutor who then sends out an email with the subject line ""Egypt Investigation."" The Post looked at this email, verified it, and it states that, quote, ""Based on review of this investigation, we would be,"" quote, ""closing the above matter with no conviction or indictment."" So it was over. That was it. Whether or not that $10 million from Cairo ended up in Trump's world and whether or not Trump knew that that $10 million was coming, and therefore he gave $10 million to his campaign knowing he would get paid back, whether Trump's actions as president, actions that greatly benefited Egypt were the result of this money influencing his decisions, we will probably never know any of this. And in the eyes of the career prosecutors working on this, because the mechanism through which we know things, investigation was shut down too early and through politically motivated bias. Now, that's my read. I'm gonna make it very clear. That's my read on this. You should read the accounts of these prosecutors who felt like it was shut down too early. My read, my connection is that it was done by a Trump ally for politically motivated reasons. And so all we're left with is this, a list of some rock solid facts that look pretty fishy, but nonetheless are not rock solid evidence of wrongdoing. In 2021, a new administration came into the White House. They could have reopened this investigation and seen it through properly. And yet, the new Attorney General wasn't briefed on this until a year later. But by then, it had been more than five years since those two bags of cash were filled with $10 million in Cairo, meaning, this thing called the statute of limitations had expired. It was too late. They couldn't actually prosecute this. The Post reached out to the Trump campaign. And in reply, they said, quote, ""The Washington Post is consistently played for suckers by deep state Trump-haters and bad faith actors peddling hoaxes and shams."" Okay. And then just recently, in September, 2023, New Jersey Democratic Senator, Bob Menendez, was charged in a case that alleges that he used his political influence to benefit Egypt in exchange for cash, gold bars, and other luxury items. - [Reporter] He accepted these gifts from businessmen acting on behalf of the Egyptian government. - He was bribed by Egypt. Like, we know Egypt does this. I mean, we could add this to the circumstantial list. Egypt likes to bribe people. Okay, to end this, I just wanna make it crystal clear, like, crystal, crystal clear that I am not saying that Donald Trump or anyone in his campaign should be convicted or found guilty for a crime in this case. It is so tempting to connect all the dots here and just say like, ""Well, yeah, clearly, he did something wrong. It all adds up."" But we just can't. That is not how justice works. Trump must be presumed innocent until there's sufficient evidence to prove otherwise. But to me, there's still something condemnable here, which is that a group of political appointees were able to shut down an investigation that career prosecutors said should not be shut down because there were further investigatory steps to take, rational reasonable steps that they would've taken on any other case. But in this case, they couldn't. That's the travesty here. To me, that's not justice, that's politics. So with that, I wanna leave you with a strong recommendation to read the full investigation from the Washington Post. There's more detail in there that sheds light on how this went down. And I'm grateful for the reporters who spent the months and months uncovering this because it brings it to light. Maybe if we see this and understand it and talk about it, it'll be less likely to happen again. Thanks for watching, folks. See you the next one. - [Donald] He's a fantastic guy. Took control of Egypt and got along. There was a good chemistry there. You know when you have good chemistry with people. You're (indistinct) of that. And there was a very good chemistry, good feeling between us. And I really enjoyed that meeting. It was the other day. And he's done a very good job and we had a very respectful meeting. (pensive music)"
2PeYDphtHYo,How Benjamin Netanyahu Relies on Hamas,Johnny Harris,News & Journalism,20240117,1494,4641877,147130,"- [Interviewer] Do the Palestinians have a right to a static state? - [Netanyahu] No, I don't think they do. But. - [Johnny] In 2007, the head of military intelligence for the Israeli army had a meeting with the US Ambassador in Tel Aviv. We're looking at the classified cable that summarizes what was talked about in this meeting. The topic of discussion was Iran, Syria, the Gaza Strip and Hamas. Hamas had just won the Palestinian elections, which kicked off a fight with the other Palestinian group, which ended in Hamas taking over Gaza completely. They controlled it. And if you're an Israeli citizen or the US government, this is a terrible set of events. Hamas is a violent extremist group known to commit heinous violence against civilians in Israel, and they were now in power. They controlled the Gaza Strip an hour away from Tel Aviv. But look at this leaked document. In this leaked cable, you see that the Israeli official says that Israel would be happy if Hamas took over Gaza because it would mean that Israel could now treat Gaza like a hostile country. - [Reporter] Three days post cease fire, and there's unrelenting bombing in Gaza. - [Johnny] This document is a view into a strategy that right-wing factions within the Israeli government have used for decades in an effort to win one of the most divisive conflicts in the world today, in which two groups are fighting over one piece of holy land and one side is winning by using a very specific tactic, one that the world says is illegal and immoral, and one that worked for a short time, but that recently has been shown to be a recipe for even worse violence and conflict and suffering. In this video, I wanna lay out what this strategy looks like and show you how it failed. I know this is a topic that is full of deep emotions that has real stakes in people's lives. Please know that I am earnest in my efforts to tell this story with clarity and with accuracy. And also please note that this is not a full account of the conflict between Israel and its neighbors, but I do hope that it sheds light on a view of the conflict that sometimes gets lost in all of the yelling. (intense music) (speaking in foreign language) (crowd cheering) For 2000 years, Jewish people around the world have been persecuted and segregated and ostracized from society. That is a fact. By the time the 1800s came around, it became clear that wherever the Jews went, persecution would follow. This is when a movement emerged calling for Jews to come together and to create a country for themselves where they could govern themselves and be free from all of this racist hatred. The creation of a Jewish country would have at the top of its priority list the security of the Jewish people. But the big question was where? Several places floated around in proposals, Argentina, even modern day Kenya, which back then was Uganda. But most people in this movement wanted the Jews to return to their historic homeland, a place called Palestine. Where Jews built their temple and their culture 3000 years ago, but then were exiled, and now there was this call to return so that Jews could feel safe after 18 centuries of Jewish suffering. So as the 1900s came around, tens of thousands of Jews, mostly from Europe, flocked to Palestine, which eventually came under control of the British. The British were getting ready to leave this region and were struggling to contain the growing conflict between Native Arabs and all these Jewish immigrants. Then in the 1940s came a horrific genocide against the Jewish people in Europe, led out by Hitler and his Nazi regime. This created a wave of international support for this idea of giving the Jewish people a homeland where they could be safe. Before they left, the British asked the UN to determine what would replace them in Palestine, and the UN decided that Palestine would become two new countries, one for the Jews and one for the Palestinian Arabs that had already been living in this region. - [Reporter] The Jewish state colored light, the Arab state dark. Jaffa to go to the Arabs, Jerusalem internationalized. - But as happens when outsiders draw lines on old land, there was a problem here. Within these borders that were meant for the new Jewish country, hundreds of thousands of Palestinian Arabs were living who would soon have to leave their homes to move to their side of the line. Okay, wait. I'm gonna pause there. Because as I said this is not a full history of the Arab-Israeli conflict. We actually just made a video on our new channel Search Party, which focuses on what happens next, the conflict between Israel and its Arab neighbors. You can go watch that. Link's in the description. It'll give you some useful context. For now just know that this led to a horrific conflict. Jewish militias forced over 700,000 Arabs out of their homes turning them into refugees. The proposed borders shifted around, turned into ceasefire lines, and after all was said and done, the Jewish people did indeed get their own country, the state of Israel. And the two important points here are that number one, the very foundation of the Israeli country is for security of the Jewish people after nearly 2000 years of persecution. And number two, the location they chose to set it up was becoming, as a result of this conflict, not much safer than Europe. (intense violin music) That's a tension that follows this whole story. Okay, so now let's fast forward to 1967. Israel has its country and they fight a short war with their Arab neighbors, and they win that war and they take over all of this land. It's a huge victory for them. I'm gonna take away the Sinai Peninsula from here because they did give that back to Egypt as part of a peace deal a few years later. Israel now controls important pieces of land that enlarge their Jewish country. Many saw this victory as a sign from God that they were actually entitled to be here. But once again, Palestinians, nearly a million of whom had been kicked out of their homes, were living here in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, which Israel now controlled, but they weren't really sure what to do with it. And it's this territory that would become the stage for the strategy that is the topic of this video, where over time this land would be sliced up with roads and checkpoints, walls and other military infrastructure that would control the movement and lives of the Palestinians. Soon, even Israeli citizens would start to move out here in large numbers building full on towns and further dividing up this territory. Moving citizens into occupied territory like this is something that the world has deemed illegal and immoral. So this occupation starts in 1967 and it goes on for decades, until eventually the Palestinians living here can't handle it anymore and they start fighting back. This is known as the first uprising for Intifada. It started with boycotts, but escalated into mass protests where Palestinians of all ages would throw stones and sometimes Molotov cocktails at much better equipped Israeli soldiers. It was Palestinian rage exploding against Israeli occupation, and it went on for years. The Israeli government would respond by cracking down, killing many Palestinians. Another important thing that happens around the same time down in the occupied Gaza Strip is that a new movement forms promising to fight back against this occupation calling for the destruction of Israel. The group is called Hamas. The first Intifada showed that this wasn't gonna work. Chopping up Palestinian land, oppressing them, keeping them in this occupation, was only going to produce more violence. It wasn't gonna fulfill Israel's promise to provide security and safety for the Jewish people. They had to switch course. - The security of the Israeli people will be reconciled with the hopes of the Palestinian people and there will be more security and more hope for all. - [Johnny] So in the 1990s, they start getting serious about peace talks with the Palestinians, and they come to this agreement called the Oslo Accords, which for the first time establishes a Palestinian government authority and giving it power to govern pockets of land in the West Bank. It also gave the Palestinians some authority over almost all of the Gaza Strip, though there were still settlements in all of these places. This was a big deal for this conflict. Like, both sides were talking to each other and coming to agreements that was giving like, authority to the Palestinians. But another theme of the story is that hardliners can use violence to derail peace. And that's exactly what happened here. Right wing Israelis start holding rallies, calling their Prime Minister a traitor and a Nazi for giving land to the Palestinians. Some of these rallies are led by a now familiar character, Benjamin Netanyahu. - The people of Israel want a real peace and real peace means peace with security. Peace they can trust with a partner they can trust, and they don't feel they have it here. We want a real peace, not a fake one. - [Johnny] But the peace talks continue. - With all our neighbors, a comprehensive peace. - [Johnny] And shortly after signing the second part of this deal to give Palestinians some land, the Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin is assassinated by a far right Israeli. Hamas conducts bus bombings. And the next year, Benjamin Netanyahu is elected as the prime minister of Israel. And Netanyahu is a key figure in this story because his worldview embodies a way of thinking that has taken root in Israel in recent years. The idea that the only way to give true security to the Jewish people is by doing whatever is necessary to stop the Palestinians from having a state anywhere in these borders. - Look, I'm 28 years old. I've had to defend my country in two wars and in many battles. Nobody wants peace more than Israel. But the stumbling block to the road for peace is this demand for a PLO state, which will mean more war, which will mean more violence in the Middle East. And I think, I sincerely believe, if this demand is abandoned, we can have real and genuine peace. - [Johnny] So that was Netanyahu. He was a 28-year-old. But when he becomes the prime minister a couple decades later, he spends his term sabotaging the peace accords that his predecessor had worked so hard to create, claiming that the occupation of all this land and its people wasn't actually conquest, but rather the key for security of the Jewish people. They had to do this. Security was the one and only justification for all of this. So under his watch settlers continue to move into the West Bank. We found this leaked video of Benjamin Netanyahu talking to some settlers in the West Bank. (several voices speaking) The cameraman does turn off the camera for a moment, but then turns it back on moments later. (Netanyahu speaking foreign language) He is admitting to sabotaging the peace accords that the Israeli government had signed with the Palestinians, that because he disagreed with them, he wanted to sabotage them because he was so against a Palestinian state or any form of Palestinian autonomy in this land. And then he goes on to explain what his real thinking is on the situation. (Netanyahu speaking foreign language) Netanyahu is a fantastic politician and statesman, and he's able to sort of cover up a lot of these policies in the name of security. But here we see what he really thinks as he's talking to these settlers thinking he's not being recorded. So unsurprisingly the appetite for peace breaks down on both sides. Palestinians come to the conclusion that the Israelis aren't really serious about giving them any kind of autonomy in the West Bank or Gaza, that their situation will never change. And once again, they rise up in a second Intifada. This one, much more violent, much more coordinated. (intense music) Hamas becomes a major player in the violence with suicide bombings and attacks. Israel responds with great force and during the fighting, 1000 Israelis and 3000 Palestinians are killed. At this point the Netanyahu way of seeing the world is starting to look a lot better. Peace talks didn't work. All they did was produce more violence. And so maybe the only way to ensure security is to go back to full blown occupation of controlling every move of the Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. So at this point the occupation gets more and more suffocating, more walls, more barriers, more checkpoints, more settlements. (intense music) Then in 2005 Israel withdraws from the Gaza Strip, letting the Palestinian Authority have total control there. They turn their attention entirely to their historic homeland of Judea and Samaria, which is the West Bank. The next year an election is held in the Palestinian Authorities and the winner surprised the world and would create a new chapter for this conflict. The winner of these elections was Hamas. - [Reporter] This is a very, very bad result for the Palestinians and for Israel. - [Johnny] The incumbent Palestinian party that had lost the election tried to forcibly hold on to power, and soon the two Palestinian parties were fighting with each other. And it results in this split between the two Palestinian governments. It turns into violence. And when the dust settles, there's suddenly a bitter divide between these two Palestinian groups, Hamas completely taking over the Gaza Strip. And this gets us back to our leaked document that we started this video with where an Israeli official is saying that they would actually be happy if Hamas took over the Gaza Strip because now they can treat Gaza like a hostile country. Now that they're not occupying it, they're not responsible for the 2 million civilians who are living there. They can impose a blockade to control anything coming in and out of the Gaza Strip, people, food, medicine, money, building supplies. But there was another reason why Israel was happy that Hamas now controlled the Gaza Strip. The Palestinian government was now deeply divided, Hamas ruling Gaza and the West Bank being run by a more moderate, secular Palestinian faction. And crucially neither considered the other to be legitimate, which weakened their ability to negotiate for any kind of state, for any kind of country, especially when Hamas still refused to recognize Israel's right to even exist. This division played right into the hands of the Israeli right. And this gets us back to Benjamin Netanyahu, that enemy of the earlier peace talks. He gets elected once again in 2009, declaring himself Mr. Security and promising to provide safety to Israeli citizens who are still shaken from the second Intifada and are now worried that Hamas now controls the entirety of the Gaza Strip. Netanyahu's playbook was already made clear. He had said it point blank. It's what he had been doing for years. Sabotaging peace talks that would give Palestinians any kind of authority over this land, and continuing to build settlements, while continuing in his words in that leaked tape to hit the Palestinians hard to make it unbearable for them. A complete assault on the Palestinian government. Dividing and slowly conquering the Palestinian people, making life hard and desperate for them, controlling their lives, watching their every move. And this is where we get to this paradoxical alignment, almost alliance between Benjamin Netanyahu and Hamas, the enemy of Israel. As long as Hamas held control over the Gaza Strip, the Palestinian cause would remain weak and divided. Netanyahu would feel justified in imposing this crippling blockade of the Gaza Strip, which in turn gave Hamas legitimacy among the people of the Gaza Strip, showing that their armed struggle against Israeli oppression was justified, provoking them to launch rockets into Israel to show that they were actually doing something unlike the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, which in turn bolstered Netanyahu's narrative that the Palestinians actually don't want peace, they want violence and the destruction of Israel. And the only way for security is more occupation, more oppression. So instead of try to take Hamas out, Netanyahu overtly supported them by approving huge transfers of untraceable cash literally delivered in suitcases into the Gaza Strip, cash that would inevitably end up in the hands of Hamas to be used against Israel. He legitimized Hamas by negotiating with them, releasing a thousand Palestinian prisoners in exchange for one Israeli. - The Israeli soldier held captive by Palestinian militants for five years is expected to be freed within days. - The more Netanyahu could keep Hamas in power in Gaza, but keep them contained, the more he could ensure that Palestinians remain divided. He could keep peace talks from ever happening, which in turn gave him time to continue to pursue his expansionist project in the West Bank. And indeed, since 2009, when Netanyahu became the Prime Minister, the number of settlements in the West Bank has only gone up. And if you look at this map, you can see how these settlements just weave through and carve up this land, making it impossible to even fathom what a Palestinian state could look like, which is precisely the point of the strategy. I actually reported out here, visiting the settlements back when I was at Vox. I did a series talking to the settlers, trying to understand why they live out there, what it's like to live in these settlements that are strangely peaceful and banal and just mundane, people living their lives, because they're protected by the army. If you want a deeper dive on settlements, you can go watch that series. But if you're Netanyahu over the last 16 years, you think your plan is working. Like, you see all these settlements going up, the international community can't do anything about it. They keep supporting you. Every once in a while there's some flare up in the West Bank where Palestinians get into a fight with Israeli soldiers, but it gets contained. Every few years Hamas fires some rockets, which then gives Israel the excuse to go, as they put it, ""cut the grass"" by conducting a short, swift, violent military campaign to keep Hamas at bay. And every day that goes by, the notion of a Palestinian state becomes less and less feasible. This is one reason why a far right Israeli lawmaker called Hamas ""an asset."" (man speaking in foreign language) So divide and conquer has been the name of the game in Israel for a long time, but especially in the last 16 years under Netanyahu. And again, to the people in charge, they think it's working. Maybe this violent status quo, this equilibrium can hold and the far right can get exactly what they want. Security for the Jewish people and expansion into all of this land. And maybe the occupation will break the Palestinian spirit and they would give up on their dream of having a state. But that's not what happened. On October 7th, 2023, we saw how wrongheaded this theory of security was. - In an unprecedented surprise attack, the militant Hamas rulers of Gaza sent dozens of fighters into Israel by land, sea, and air. - This deadly attack launched by Hamas showed us that while Netanyahu's strategy of divide and conquer might be good for taking over more land, what it's not good for is making good on the original promise of Israel, which is ensuring the security of the Jewish people. In fact, his strategy has produced exactly the opposite. (crowd chanting in foreign language) Now, the responsibility for what happened on October 7th lies with the people who committed those acts of terror, Hamas fighters and their leaders. There is no excuse or justification for their actions. But the point I'm trying to make with this video is that there's also others that need to stand accountable here. Those who used Hamas as a pawn to continue this divide and conquer policy, who are now engaged in a campaign of mass bloodshed on civilians, they deserve to stand accountable as well, to the Israeli people and to the countries that support Israel. I believe in the need for a Jewish state. I do. I think that's a very reasonable proposal that Jewish people should feel safe somewhere in this world. And yet what we're looking at isn't it. The Israeli project, the way that it's been wielded in its current form, produces the exact opposite of security for the Jewish people. Thanks for watching, and I know that you probably have thoughts, and I'm sure a lot of you disagree with what I've said here, and that's okay. I want to hear from you. I want to listen to that and I will see you down in the comments. Today's video, we didn't have a normal sponsor because a lot of people right now don't want to be attached to this discussion. But luckily I can tell you about something that is a big support to our journalism, which is Nebula. Nebula's a platform where we publish all of our videos ad-free. It is a platform that is run and owned by creators, which makes a big difference for a lot of reasons. But it is a place where creators like me who like to learn about the world publish their stuff. On Nebula you'll also find stuff that you can't find anywhere else, stuff that's exclusive to the Nebula platform. These are called Nebula Originals. Stuff like Modern Conflicts by RealLifeLore is extremely rigorous and well-told and explains how wars are fought today. And again, you can't watch it anywhere else. The other thing I love about Nebula is that I find new creators and new shows here, like this is a new series called Red Atoms. It's about the Soviet Nuclear Program, and it's just really high-quality stuff. It's very similar to what you see here, but you can't get it anywhere else. It's not on YouTube. There are loads of these kinds of series on Nebula, and when you sign up, you support the creators who make this stuff. Including us here. We're trying to do independent journalism and deep dive investigations and visual explainers, and it's a big effort. We have a big team of people that make this all happen.

qsO-rULEfrk,"The War in Yemen, Mapped",Johnny Harris,News & Journalism,20240517,1329,3216243,77205,"- [Johnny] Along the banks of the most important waterway on earth sits the country of Yemen, a place that was two countries for decades until the year 1990, when it was unified into one. A fragile patchwork of groups all with different tribal backgrounds, religious beliefs, and political aspirations. The story I want to tell starts in the '90s, when one group forms up in the northern mountains of Yemen. It's started by a group of religious Yemenis who call themselves the Believing Youth, who were members of a Shiite Muslim sect called the Zaidi. Zaidi Muslims used to be the majority when the country was split in two. But in the new unified Yemen, they became a minority and felt neglected and discriminated against. At first, the group focuses on rebuilding the Zaidi religious identity, hosting summer camps for young men and offering religious education. But in the late 1990s, the group starts to change in important ways. A member of Yemen's parliament resigns in protest and joins the Believing Youth. He felt that the government of Yemen was corrupt and far too influenced by Yemen's neighbor to the north, Saudi Arabia. Al Houthi blamed outside influence for many of the country's problems. So as he leaves the government, Al Houthi uses his wealth and family connections in the Zaidi community to become the leader of the Believing Youth. He wants an Islamic revolution, modeled after the one in Iran. One that kicks out any foreign influence and restores Islamic values. - [Reporter] Outrage with the speed of the human shout. - With Al Houthi's influence, this group of young men in the mountainous region of Yemen starts to change. They begin protesting Yemen's president, Ali Abdullah Saleh. Soon they start taking up weapons, taking over territory, and eventually setting up their own security checkpoints in their region. The Believing Youth are starting to look a lot less like a summer camp and a lot more like a militia, like a rebellion. President Saleh, who had previously supported the Believing Youth, is starting to get worried. And then in 2001, the entire Middle East would change forever. After 9/11, the US launches a war on terror. (reflective music) They asked President Saleh for help, and he cooperates, taking military aid and allowing American Special Forces to operate inside Yemen, where the terrorist group Al-Qaeda has a presence. 18 months later, the US presence in the region would balloon even more when the American military invades and occupies Iraq. For Al Houthi and his group of young men, this crosses a red line and deeply radicalizes the movement. Al Houthi criticizes the president publicly for pandering to what he sees as American imperialism in Muslim lands. And many in Yemen agree, joining the movement and bolstering their numbers. Al Houthi adopts the violent slogan that sits on the flag of his movement to this day: God is great. Death to America. Death to Israel. Curse on the Jews. Victory to Islam. President Saleh feels threatened by the growth of this increasingly radical movement that is taking control of territory in the north. He issues an arrest warrant and a bounty for Al Houthi and brutally cracks down on their protests. In response, the Believing Youth launch an armed rebellion in the north of Yemen, leading to counterattacks by the Yemeni military. Shortly after the fighting begins, Al Houthi is killed in a cave in the north. The rebels he leaves behind fight on with new conviction, and the world would know them by the name of their martyr, a symbol of imperial resistance that would soon be firing rockets at Israel and hijacking cargo ships in the Red Sea. (reflective music) This Yemen story is about to get really fascinating. I'm gonna pause for a second because I need to thank the sponsor of today's video.

Thank you, Incogni, for sponsoring today's video. With that, let's dive back into Yemen. By 2004, the Houthis have morphed into a full-blown rebellion, fighting against Yemen's government from their northern strongholds. They know this land well and they have local support, allowing them to fight a guerrilla campaign against the government forces, blending in with civilians, hiding in mountains and caves, and allowing them to resist the much better equipped Yemeni army. As the conflict turns more violent, more tribes in the region would feel that the military is being overly brutal, leading them to join the Houthis. And it's at this time that the conflict goes international. The Houthis say that Saudi Arabia is letting the government of Yemen position troops right across this border. So they invade into Saudi Arabia, killing Saudi soldiers and taking hostages. This pulls Saudi Arabia into the conflict, as they respond with airstrikes and troops and push the Houthis out of their territory, punishing them for this invasion. Now, over here, Iran is watching this war, and they see an opportunity. The Houthis are now fighting directly against their biggest rival, Saudi Arabia. So they start secretly sending weapons to the Houthis. At least that's what Saudi Arabia claims, saying that they intercepted an Iranian ship filled with weapons and military trainers on their way to the Houthis. It looks like Iran is directly supporting the Houthis now. Though how much support they provide behind the scenes will always be intentionally unclear. As the conflict between the Houthis and the government continues in the north, Saudi Arabia has been fighting their own war on terror against a branch of Al-Qaeda operating in Saudi Arabia. Seeing that their days are numbered, this branch of Al-Qaeda flees south over the border into Yemen, where they merge their forces with the Yemen branch of Al-Qaeda. They create Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, one of the most dangerous and well-funded versions of the group to ever exist. The group's goal is to create a strict Islamic state across the whole region, while violently waging holy war against foreigners in Muslim lands. (reflective music) This puts them at odds with both the Yemeni government and the Houthis. The conflict is getting more complicated. Around 2011, the region starts to change in big ways. In one country after another, there's an outpouring of public anger on the streets, demanding change from their government, removing old leaders. This is called the Arab Spring. It's upheaval that spirals the region into hope and chaos. (protesters shouting in foreign language) - [Johnny] Iran and Saudi Arabia see this as an opportunity to strategically choose sides in all of these countries, in hopes that when the dust settles, they will come out with a stronger hand of allies in the region. And one of their main focuses is Yemen, a country that is also rising up, calling for President Saleh to step down. The corrupt dictator of Yemen is running out of time, which is something the Houthis have been fighting for for years. But Saleh refuses to step down, adding fuel to the uprising. Saudi Arabia sees this situation at their southern border and decides to step in with the help of the UN, convincing Saleh to transfer power to his vice president, in exchange for immunity from prosecution. On his way out, Saleh takes the billions of dollars that he corruptly amassed during his time in office, and he also retains the loyalty of key parts of the military, fighters that are only loyal to him. But the people aren't satisfied with this new Saudi-backed president. The government remains weak and unorganized. Meanwhile, the Houthis are taking advantage of this infighting and only getting stronger, taking more and more territory from the government, adding to their forces, and receiving more support from their backer, Iran, who is supplying them with more training, missiles, drones, and other advanced weapons. They use these weapons in the fall of 2014 to march into southern Yemen, taking over large swaths of territory. (reflective music) Now that the Houthis have momentum, the former President Saleh joins them in an alliance of convenience. In fact, Saleh's forces are critical in helping the Houthis take the capital city of Sana'a. Saleh is now working with his former enemy, against his own vice president, the man he had to give power to when he stepped down. President Hadi and his government flee south as the Houthis take over, but the Houthis are right behind them. So Hadi has to flee to Saudi Arabia, trying to govern Yemen from there. But the Houthis just keep gaining momentum. By the middle of 2015, they now control the capital city completely, where they create their own government and take control of the government's military weapons, helping them expand even further into the south. Now that the Houthis are in power, they run an oppressive regime that silences free speech, crushes dissent through arrest and torture, and recruits children as soldiers, all while imposing strict religious laws that undermine women's rights. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia is getting nervous. Their southern neighbor is now controlled by a group that is funded by their biggest enemy. So they recruit the support of countries around the region and invade Yemen, with the goal of removing the Houthis from power. The war is led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia's up-and-coming leader and defense minister. He starts with a widespread bombing campaign and a naval blockade that prevents shipping in and out of the country, with the goal of trying to cut off support coming in from Iran. The crown prince turns to the United States in need of more weapons for this war. While the US leaders are reluctant to get involved in another Middle East conflict, they also want to maintain a good relationship with Saudi Arabia, who is their major security and energy partner in the region. They also have an interest in weakening Al-Qaeda's growing presence in Yemen. So in addition to supporting this war with logistics and intelligence, President Obama approves billions of dollars of weapons: planes, tanks, and even weapons banned by most of the world for how dangerous they are for civilians, like cluster munitions. (tense music) This quickly turns Saudi Arabia into the largest importer of American weapons for the next four years. So it's 2015, and Yemen is in a full-blown war between the Houthis and Saudi Arabia and their coalition. This is when Al-Qaeda, who's not on either side, takes advantage of this chaos and makes a land grab in the middle of Yemen. They take major cities and clash with government forces. Also taking advantage of the instability is the terrorist group ISIS, who come to Yemen and fight the Houthis and Al-Qaeda, at the same time. Though their attacks are scattered, and they don't control significant territory. The US then gets more involved by launching airstrikes at Al-Qaeda and ISIS targets to stop them from gaining any more territory. They tried to kill their leadership. But the US has to do this carefully because they don't want to engage the Houthis. Their fight is with Al-Qaeda and ISIS. In May of 2015, the Houthis attack a city just across the border in Saudi Arabia, killing two and taking hostages, forcing an airport to shut down. The crown prince doesn't take being attacked on his own soil lightly, especially by Iran's proxies. So over the next 24 hours, the Saudis launch 130 airstrikes in Yemen, hitting homes, schools, and hospitals. Thousands are forced to flee from their home. Hundreds are reported dead, though we'll never know the real death toll. These strikes are almost immediately called war crimes. But the crown prince doesn't back down. His coalition then sends in ground troops from the south, pushing back the Houthis and taking back the city of Aden. He's behaving as if he's fighting his greatest enemy, Iran. It's a vicious cycle that is common in proxy wars like this, and it lands the people of Yemen in the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. The international community tries to intervene with diplomatic efforts to stop the fighting. But over the next six years, those efforts would fail, and Saudi Arabia would continue its brutal campaign, all using American weapons. The Houthis continue to fight, to show that they are legitimate, that they are the government of Yemen. They aren't just doing Iran's bidding. (somber music) The war continues to destroy cities and land, and the blockade continues to keep trade out. The Saudis continue to bomb indiscriminately. And with time, 2 million Yemenis are displaced, forced to leave their homes to flee this violence. - [Reporter] 150,000 civilians have had to- - [Johnny] But this doesn't stop the Houthis from escalating their offensive. They start attacking Saudi Arabia directly with missiles and drones in their capital city and their civilian airports, using weapons that most believe are coming from Iran. (tense music) In December of 2017, the Saudis and the UAE convinced President Saleh to break his alliance with the Houthis and return to power as president of Yemen. They hope that Saleh, the former dictator, might be able to hold onto power and rule more effectively. Saleh takes the deal and changes sides yet again, breaking with the Houthis and joining the Saudi-led coalition. (reflective music) Fighting breaks out between the Houthis and Saleh's militias, and Saleh is killed just two days later. (reflective music) Meanwhile, in the United States, there's a new president. President Trump orders increased drone strikes and raids against Al-Qaeda, helping government forces take back large amounts of territory. Despite the war crimes committed using American weapons, Trump approves more weapons sales to Saudi Arabia to wage this war. And then in 2018, the conflict takes on a new dimension. The UAE, who's a part of the Saudi-led coalition, is starting to lose faith in the direction this war is going. They don't like the current government of Yemen, and they're losing soldiers on the ground. It's damaging their reputation on the world stage. So the UAE leaves the coalition. But they still want to influence who will ultimately control Yemen, so they start backing a new group in the south called the Southern Transitional Council, or STC. This group isn't aligned with the government or the Houthis. They're calling for a separation of the southern part of Yemen. They want their own state. They want their own country. So the UAE starts to withdraw their troops from the south of the country, and the STC separatists start taking control of southern provinces. The Saudi coalition is fracturing, and yet another group is jumping into the fighting, showing just how up for grabs Yemen has become. By the fall of 2019, the war has reached maximum complexity. You've got the Saudi coalition backing the former government of Yemen, mostly relegated to the east of the country. The UAE is now backing this separatist movement in the south, who are fighting against the former government of Yemen. The Houthis backed by Iran still maintain majority control of the major cities in the north. Al-Qaeda and its militia allies are still fighting to control small slices of the country. And the US continues to conduct airstrikes against Al-Qaeda and ISIS, while supporting and selling more weapons to the Saudi coalition. Yemen is fracturing further, and if there's any hope for peace, power needs to be consolidated. So Saudi Arabia and the UAE make amends, and then, together, they convince the government of Yemen and the separatists in the south to form a new coalition to fight against the Houthis together as a united front. But it doesn't stop the Houthis, who are getting really good at fighting and are firing more Iranian missiles and drones into Saudi Arabia, hitting state-owned oil refineries and threatening to drive up oil prices globally. By January 2021, the Houthis, a group started to provide religious summer camps to young men, are now battle hardened, and they control 70 to 80% of the population of Yemen. Later that year, the UN announces that approximately 20 million of those people are dependent on humanitarian aid for their daily needs. And at this point, the war starts to settle in to an uncomfortable stalemate. (somber music) In April 2022, the UN brokers a ceasefire, and the fighting stops. Behind the scenes, Saudi Arabia and Iran have been in diplomatic talks, sponsored by China. Regional tensions are cooling, which means that their proxy war in Yemen is also cooling. Saudi Arabia has had enough of the fighting. President Hadi resigns and hands power over to a council meant to govern Yemen and manage the war. And both sides are tired of the fighting. So when that ceasefire is set to expire in October 2022, the conflict mostly stays quiet, even without a new agreement. By 2023, Saudi Arabia and Iran have officially restored their diplomatic relations. Saudi Arabia hoping that this means Iran will stop supporting Houthis to attack their southern border. (somber music) But the Saudis keep their maritime blockade around the country, making life in Yemen unlivable for millions. But at this point, the heaviest of the fighting on all sides has stopped. But then in the fall of 2023, the Houthis were back in the news. After the Palestinian group Hamas launches a brutal attack into Israel, the Israeli military invades the Gaza Strip, vowing to destroy Hamas and free the hostages that they took. The campaign leads to tens of thousands of Palestinian civilian deaths, and it provokes a response from Iranian-backed groups all throughout the region. The Houthis are one of those groups. They launch drones and cruise missiles into southern Israel, vowing that their attacks won't stop until the invasion of Gaza stops. And then they start firing their missiles and drones at cargo ships that are traveling through the Red Sea, where 25% of container traffic travels, a major artery in our global economy. In the days after these missiles start flying, traffic through this Red Sea route declines by 73%. In response, the US and UK shoot down Houthi missiles and drop bombs on Houthi military targets in Yemen, pulling the US and its allies deeper into this enduring conflict. (reflective music) The reason I wanted to tell you the story of this conflict in Yemen. Because it represents the vicious cycle present in a lot of proxy wars, where geopolitical rivals use their neighbors as battlefields instead of fighting each other directly. They fund and add fuel to local conflicts, escalating them to the entire country, and often to the entire region, leaving violence and power vacuums in their wake, which are then filled by bad actors trying to take advantage of the instability. All of this changes Borders, destroys cities, and ruins lives. It's the story of powerful countries and their cynical scramble for influence and power in vulnerable places, leaving behind them a wake of tremendous human suffering. (somber music)"
