1U51yx3FwAY,Nukes are way scarier than you think,,News & Journalism,"(plane engine roaring) - I'm in Washington, DC right now, and I want to visualize for you what it would look like if a nuclear weapon landed on the nation's capital. So, for our scenario, there is a nuclear weapon headed towards the city right now. (dramatic music) A large nuclear weapon flying headed towards Washington, DC. The actual bomb is actually in here. This cone that's about two meters tall, six feet. It's falling back into the atmosphere. Here it comes. And then, for a moment, right here is the hottest thing in our solar system, hotter than the sun. 100 million degrees Celsius as it expands out. Everything around it turns into dust. I mean, smaller than dust. Atoms are ripped apart. This fireball instantly vaporizes everything within a half a mile radius. And here comes the blast wave, a wall of high-pressure air that is moving faster than the speed of sound. It creates wind behind it that is faster than anything ever observed in nature. Everything within two and a half miles is leveled. And then there's the heat wave, which burns everything within five miles. Nearly everyone in this city is either dead or severely injured. Everything that can be on fire is now on fire as this huge mushroom cloud rises into the air, dragging with it a storm of dust, dirt, and debris. But this isn't normal dust anymore. The bomb has done something to it, to its atoms, making them fall apart in slow motion, shooting out invisible, deadly energy. This poison dust drifts all across this region. It clings to soil and plants and people, hundreds of miles away. (soft music) These poisoned atoms will keep firing off radiation for years, for decades, centuries, even thousands of years. This is a disaster that humans made. And that was just for one of these cones. A rocket fired from an American submarine can carry eight of these cones at once. If all of those hit one target, it would be a much worse situation. (soft music) A lot of global politics centers around this, making sure this does not happen. But everything I just showed you is very possible. We have the capabilities to do this right now. And in fact, a lot of countries have their finger on the trigger, able to launch one of these at a moment's notice. And I've spent a very long time trying to understand why. Why have we done this? And why these nuclear weapons, which were famous during the Cold War, are back. They're back in a new way. They're once again becoming the center of global politics. - We are entering one of the most dangerous periods in nuclear history. We're on the cusp of this third age. That nuclear is back. - That's Sam from Search Party. He also made a video about nuclear weapons, but it's different than mine. It went live yesterday. In this video, I'm gonna show you how these things work, what countries have them, and how they're used on the global stage. And then Sam's video will take you into this specific moment in time and what to look out for going forward. Help you understand why nuclear weapons are back on the world stage. We're headed into a world that is more and more informed by nuclear weapons and nuclear politics. So it's time we start paying attention. Let me show you. (gentle music) Everyone's telling me that they don't like that my screen shakes. Listen, I can't help it. This thing's big. It's unruly. Sorry. Okay, so what is this thing? Well, it's a bomb, obviously, a very destructive bomb. And it's one that messes with the very building blocks of everything, the atom. - [Narrator] Atoms are the tiny building blocks, which make up everything in the world. - So an atom, of course, is the smallest unit of matter, right? And it's made up of several subatomic particles, electrons, protons, neutrons. - I talked to Destin from the YouTube channel Smarter Every Day. He's a real scientist, engineer. He's making a bunch of videos on nuclear energy. And I talked to him because I wanted to make sure I was grounded in my understanding of the physics of a nuclear bomb. Everything is atoms. Everything that you can touch, the air, everything is atoms, different kinds of atoms. And these atoms have a little secret hiding in them. Every single atom can be turned into energy. Like actually matter, like atoms and energy are the same thing. They're just in different states. - When I was growing up, dad used to always say matter is frozen energy. - Like this could be turned into energy and actually a lot of energy that could like fuel a car or like power my house or like fly me to the moon. And it doesn't take that much mass to create a lot of energy. Let me show you this really quick. This little piece of metal is probably a little more than a gram. Not very heavy, not a lot of mass, right? If we zoom way into this little clip, you're gonna see a bunch of atoms. Now there are some powerful forces working on this atom, keeping the nucleus really tightly glued together, keeping the atoms separate from each other so they don't like blob into one another. And thank God for this because otherwise nothing would be solid. You would sit in a chair and just sort of fall through. There's a lot of forces happening down with the atoms, keeping everything stable, everything solid. We like these forces. They make it so that my little paperclip thingy doesn't explode and everything doesn't sort of spontaneously come apart. Stable, good. - Those forces, those subatomic forces are very, very strong. - Now you can break these forces holding atoms together. If you rock their world hard enough, they will kind of rearrange. They will break. And then they'll quickly like reorganize to try to form some sort of stable atom. But in the process, a little bit of matter is left with nowhere to go. It can't bond to anything. And so it spontaneously turns into energy. Every single thing around you, everything could be turned into energy, an enormous amount of energy. How much energy? I'm glad you asked because this is the moment that I've been waiting for since I was a child, where in my real adult career, I'm going to be able to invoke the famous equation of our very own Albert Einstein. Yep, I'm pulling, I'm doing this. I'm doing the chalkboard thing. For those of you who already know about E equals MC squared and exactly what it means, like skip like 45 seconds ahead because I'm about to explain it in a way that I've always wanted someone to explain it to me. And I'm gonna do that for you. (soft music) Could have guessed that was gonna happen. So what does Einstein say about how much energy is contained in my little paper clippy thing? The E is energy. The M is mass. How much mass are we turning into energy? And the C is the speed of light in meters per second. Speed. The mass of my paper clip is one gram. Because this is in kilograms, it's gonna be 0.001. I just need to times this by speed of light squared is about 299 million meters per second. But we have to times it by itself, which comes out to be 89 quadrillion, 875 trillion, 570 billion, 873 million, 681 thousand, 764. Whoa. So my paper clip mass times this. Einstein says we have to multiply that big number by the mass of this paper clip to find out how much energy is inside of it. And if you do that math with my one gram, you get 89 trillion joules. That's enough energy to power 100,000 homes for two weeks or one home for 2,000 years. Just inside of this. Because of that. (soft music) Okay, giant caveat for everyone watching and those who study physics will be clamoring for this. You can't actually do that with like an iron paper clip. The amount of energy you would need to like turn this into energy would sort of be more than the energy you get out of it. To actually do this, to release the energy from matter, you need different kinds of atoms, like big unstable ones, like the ones we see in uranium. My point here is not that this is ever gonna like break and turn into energy, but that when you mess with atoms, the bonds within atoms, and you release a little bit of matter into energy, you don't need very much to create a huge amount. That's what we're about to see in real life. - So fission is a big atom splitting. Fusion, little atoms coming together. - I had a fun time watching Destin show me how fission works in his studio with his very cute looking neutrons and mouse traps. He made a whole video about it that you can check out. Now for most of time, the only place that this sort of turning matter into energy was happening was not here on earth, but in the center of stars. - And this is the kind of stuff that happens in the core of the sun, for example, - where immense heat and pressure is smashing atoms together so hard that they fuse. They rearrange a little bit, a little bit of matter that isn't fused, turns into energy and you get the literal sun. That's called fusion. But then in the 1900s, the humans on earth decided they wanted to start to do something like this themselves. As I talked about nuclear politics is ramping up in a new way. Iran is the best example of where this is clearly happening where there's just like a lot of secrecy and vague information as a negotiating tactic. And it's a really normal thing to feel like you're just left with a bunch of headlines and leaks and half answers, but no real clear picture, which is exactly why I am a giant fan and big user of Ground News, who is the sponsor of today's video. Ground News is this amazing tool that allows you to see the coverage of a topic from so many different angles all in one view. And you're not just seeing a bunch of headlines, you are getting a deep understanding of what bias that headline might have, what agenda they might have, who might be funding them, how credible or factual they are. Ground News is a longtime partner of the channel. I'm a big fan of what they do. We align very much in our mission to make information more transparent, more clear for people. It's an app and a website that helps me go beyond the echo chamber of social media and see a story from a much deeper perspective. I mean, let's just go back to the Iran example. You can see here on Ground News in one view, a bunch of different headlines, like pull these two out. You can immediately see that this is funded by the government of Qatar. It's high factuality, but it leans left. And their headline emphasizes a framing of Iran rejecting this IAEA report and downplaying the threat and casting doubt on the international narrative. Whereas this Israeli outlet has a more mixed record. It leans right and it cuts right to the chase and says clearly and slightly misleadingly that Iran has enriched uranium for 10 nuclear bombs and is continuing production. Same story, two totally different angles. Ground News is the only platform I know of where you can see all of these headlines side by side with all of this information and quickly get a grasp of what is going on. It also helps you be less echo chamber-ish with its blind spot feature, showing you stories that you may not be likely to click on or that you are either avoiding consciously or unconsciously. Ground News helps me feel informed in a very short time and sort of ahead of the narrative. And it's not just me. Ground News was recently recognized by the literal Nobel Peace Center for its impact on media literacy. It's completely subscriber funded. And for those who are interested, they are giving a big discount to anyone who goes to ground.news/johnnyharris. You can scan this QR code as well and you will get 40% off the vantage plan, which is all of these features I talked about today. I think it ends up being like five bucks a month all in. So small price to pay for being informed. Thank you, Ground News, for sponsoring today's video, for being a longtime partner, for doing what you do. And with that, let's keep talking about nukes. (soft music) It was the 1930s in Germany and some scientists were tinkering with atoms and they found a way to break some atoms apart and get in on this insanity of E equals MC squared. - Pretty crazy how safe nuclear power is. But nuclear weapons are scary, aren't they? - Yeah. - When uranium-235 exists in nature, it's not real happy. It's kind of unstable. If a U-235 atom ever gets hit by a neutron, which I have, I happen to have a neutron here. If U-235 ever gets hit by a neutron, then it gets really unstable and then it breaks apart. That right there breaks into two other atoms. I threw my neutron across the room. That's dangerous when you've got U-235 around. I think of U-235 like a mousetrap. So if you think about it, you've got this atom chilling out and it's got all these neutrons right there, ready to go. If it ever gets triggered, then it will fire and it will throw off these other neutrons and they go off. And so if you have a clever arrangement of more U-235 atoms around that, then you can start what's called a chain reaction. - [Narrator] Those neutrons bombard other uranium atoms, causing them to split and split still others. The result, a chain reaction. - They were doing fission, the breaking of big unstable atoms apart. And this wasn't as powerful as the fusion, the combining of atoms that's happening in the center of the sun, but it was still unlike anything the world had ever seen. - Under Hitler, the country was becoming the dominant power in Central Europe. - Germany was kind of getting ready to take over the entire world. And so they thought, what if we weaponize this new nuclear breaking thing we invented? And Einstein, the E=mc2 guy was alive at this time and watching his equations be turned into weapons. And Einstein writes this letter to the American president urging the U.S. to make the bomb before Germany does. And this is where we get into Oppenheimer, the Manhattan Project, brilliant physicists building atomic bombs in the desert, racing against time during World War II. The U.S. of course wins this race for the nuclear weapon. They dropped two of these fission bombs on Japan in 1945. The war is over and the world has changed forever. Nothing would ever be the same. It was the beginning of a new way of global conflict. A few years later, the Soviets made one of their own and thus begins a new race. Who can make the bigger bomb? And this is where the U.S. is like, let's not just do the thing where we break atoms apart, let's do what the sun is doing, fuse the atoms together. That's way more powerful. And they figure it out just a few years later and the results are insane. - [Speaker] Those are capable of megatons of power. A thousand times more powerful. Because apparently leveling a city was not powerful enough. (upbeat music) - Let me show you what today's nukes look like and how they work. This is a modern nuclear weapon, sometimes called a thermonuclear weapon, hydrogen bomb. This cone is about the same height as an American male. And the actual bomb is in here. We don't know exactly how big it is, but we know it's shaped like a peanut. This cone needs to be mounted on something to deliver it to the target. In this example, it's on a huge rocket that flies to space, can carry this nuke like over a thousand kilometers away. Eventually the rocket part falls away and the cone starts falling towards its target. And then when it hits its pre-programmed altitude, it detonates. But watch what happens, this is crazy. It's actually three bombs. It starts with just a regular old explosive bomb, no nuclear stuff yet. But this bomb inside of this very small peanut shaped space triggers a fission bomb. The first type that we invented, the one that overcomes the forces, keeping an atom stable and breaks them apart and turns a tiny bit of matter into a huge amount of energy. So there's a fission reaction happening and that shoots out a huge amount of energy at the speed of light that bounces off all these shiny beryllium walls. And then it hits this, and this is the final one. It's so hot in here, 100 million degrees Celsius, that we're basically in the core of a star. It's actually hotter than the core of our sun. Hot enough to do things that stars do. So now in this third bomb, the big one, hydrogen atoms are being smashed together into a new form. A little bit of matter is escaping into E equals MC square being multiplied by the speed of light squared. And what you get is total destruction. Yeah, I mean, we made that. We made that, that is possible. Those big ones have never been used in war and hopefully they never will. Okay, but how big are these? Let's put them on a city, my city, Washington, DC. Terrible thought, but we gotta do this exercise. If you were to drop a fission bomb, like the ones we dropped on Japan that killed hundreds of thousands, it would look like this. Upgrade that to a fusion bomb, like the ones deployed today, and it would look like this. Estimated 350,000 people dead in minutes. During the Cold War, we made these things huge. If you detonate the biggest fusion bomb ever tested, it would look like this. The city would be gone and people 40 miles away in like Baltimore would have life-threatening burns from the heat wave. 300 square miles of buildings destroyed. I mean, this is a horrible possibility that we have invented, and we have a lot of them. (ominous music) Let's look at a map. I like looking at maps. We can't go too long without looking at a map. Today, there are around 12,000 nuclear warheads somewhere on Earth. That's 12,000, 12,000. That's enough firepower to level every sizable city on the planet several times over. The world used to have way more, like more than triple that during the Cold War. Almost every one of these nuclear warheads today is in the hands of two countries, the US and Russia. But in total, there are nine countries that possess these destructive bombs. And one of these countries doesn't admit that they have nuclear weapons, but they do. And America's nukes aren't just in America. They're scattered all over the world, in ally countries, on land, in air, deep in the ocean, lurking in submarines, in a configuration that the US calls its nuclear posture. It's one of the most important parts of America's military strategy today. And we're about to see how it actually works in real life because these 12,000 nukes shape our entire world. Their threat is ever-present. And so it turns the chessboard of geopolitics into a different thing than it was before. - Nuclear weapons, of course, did revolutionize warfare, so Bernard Brody in 1946 calls them the absolute weapon. He says that basically before the bomb was invented, the fundamental purpose of military establishments was to plan for, fight, and win wars, and now it would be to prevent them altogether. - So what stops countries from nuking each other? Well, uh-oh, my camera's shaking again. See you in the comments, folks. I don't have a way to stabilize this in a way that really keeps it from bouncing around. If you have suggestions on a better camera arm, I'll take it. So the central idea of all of this is pretty simple, pretty intuitive, kind of, but then it kind of messes with your brain in weird ways, and we'll see how that works. You've got these two big empires, they're rivals, they're competing with each other as big countries do and have always done, and maybe someday they won't, but they do for now. If there's no nukes in this equation, history has taught us that these two big empires will fight each other over land, over influence, over resources, over honor, over who knows. They will fight each other. That always has happened. That is the central threat of humanity, is big, powerful entities will fight each other. In recent centuries, it's gotten really destructive. Think of Europe and Asia in the 1940s. Countries are fighting because there's a chance that one of them can win. Okay, now, after 1945, put nukes on the board and watch what happens. - This new weapon that could inflict damage of the kind that we just never before imagined in human history. - Now, if these two empires get into a war with each other, they both know that it will escalate. They will keep using more and more extreme force until eventually one side will use nukes, to which the other will respond with their own nukes. And then it's game over for everyone. Nobody wins, everybody loses, the world is on fire. The concept of victory becomes irrelevant because everyone's dead. This creates a calculus of fear, an understanding that you will inflict way more consequences on yourself if you go to war with your geopolitical rival. And this threat of total destruction is stronger than the urge to fight and dominate. After World War II, after we witnessed this destructive bomb in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, something changed. We crossed a line of understanding that there really was something that could really sort of end it all. - It's about convincing the other side that attacking is just not worth it. Convincing both sides that the price is just too high. And unfortunately that means deterrence. - Deterrence, that is the word, that is the key concept. Comes from this root of like avoidance of something because of terror, fear. Terror prevents you from acting. And it weirdly, strangely, paradoxically kind of works. Though this is debated by scholars and when I was in grad school for peace and conflict resolution, there was a lot of compelling evidence that deterrence doesn't work, but I'm not getting into the literature right now. It is widely accepted that one of the major reasons great powers have not gone to war with each other directly in the last 70, 80 years is because of nuclear weapons. For those who wanna dispute that claim, I am so stoked for your good faith argument and dissent in the comments. I will read it and respond 'cause I love this stuff. Anyway, global politics today leans heavily on this grim logic, this balance of deterrence created by very destructive bombs that split atoms. But in order for deterrence to work, it can't just be the bombs. It has to have some other important ingredients. (upbeat music) First up, the threat needs to be believable. It needs to be credible. Your enemy has to believe that you will actually, credibly fire back a nuke, that you're not just making empty threats and bluffing all the time, that you actually have the ability and appetite to fire one of these things off. What that means is you gotta have these things ready to go at all times. You gotta have maps of targets to hit, thousands of targets in some cases, like here in these giant maps in a bunker command center that the U.S. had showing all the targets in the Soviet Union that they were ready to hit. The Soviets, of course, had a similar map of all the targets they were ready to hit. During the Cold War, the U.S. had a bomber plane with a nuke on it in the air 24/7 for eight years. It wasn't the same plane. They were obviously doing patrols, but there was always one in the air ready to drop a nuke. And this is why it remained a Cold War. But the Soviet Union fell and the big standoff kind of chilled out a little bit. But today, credibility is just as important to all of the nuclear powers, especially the big dogs, U.S., China, Russia. They all still have their nukes pointed at each other all the time. And all three make it really easy to make the decision to launch one. They centralize the decision-making into one person, the top leader. Like in the United States, we do this. The president is the sole authority who can authorize a nuclear strike. And legally, no one can veto his decision. He could launch a nuke within five minutes using some special authorization codes and relying on this football. I know it's not a football. It's a briefcase, but it's called the nuclear football. And inside of this, there's a phone and a scary black book that lists out all of the potential targets that the president could authorize a strike on. How many people would die? What the effect would be? It's all right there by his side all the time. And for those wondering, yes, it's that kind of football. Sorry, world. This is America. Okay, the next ingredient to deterrence is the ability to hit back. Meaning if one nuclear country is able to destroy all of your nukes in a surprise attack, then the whole thing falls apart. They now are not deterred because they can disarm you. So you gotta have more than one nuke and you kinda gotta spread them out and hide them. The US does this by spreading its nukes out all throughout the world and dividing them up by delivery methods. Some are sitting in these big underground silos that are spread all across the middle of the country. There's just rockets in here, ready to launch at a moment's notice. Others are sitting on airplanes positioned all around the globe. And as of two weeks ago, the US positioned 10 of its bombers, probably carrying nukes, here on this tiny little island in the Indian Ocean called Diego Garcia, which I've made a video about and want to make another video about 'cause it's wild. And yeah, there's just nukes on this island. North Korea, China, Russia, Iran, beware, there's nukes here, says the United States. And then of course, we've got nukes lurking in the depths of the ocean, sitting on submarines. These underwater buildings that are weapons and bases and command centers all in one. They can carry up to 20 missiles, each of them with multiple warheads. It's like the amount of destruction capability designed into these weapons is kind of unfathomable. And that's kind of the point. It has to be so bad, so easy to launch that your enemy's like not messing with that. Anyway, these different delivery systems are called the nuclear triad. Russia has something like it too. China's kind of developing their own triad. And all of this is so that we have that second ingredient of deterrence, the ability to strike back. These things are safe from a surprise attack that would take out all of our nukes. Okay, so you've got credibility in that you're ready to go. You've got a second strike capability, but where the rubber meets the road is the last ingredient. And this is where the mind games begin. Red lines. You have to signal to your enemy what they would have to do to warrant an attack. - The signal to each other on what to do and what to not do. So you can create guardrails for your competition. - The cleanest and safest way to do this is to just say, ""Hey, we will not attack anyone ""with our nukes unless they attack us ""with their nukes first."" This is called a no-first-use policy or nuclear doctrine. It's pretty straightforward, and it's much more about just protecting your national survival. And this is what China has articulated as their policy. Most countries operate with this as their kind of de facto policy. ""Don't attack us with nukes or we'll nuke you back."" It's a way of deterring anyone from trying to attack them. - Most other countries that has nuclear weapons fundamentally relies on them to assure the existence of their country. You have nuclear weapons and they're survivable, your country's probably not gonna be wiped off the map or be invaded. - But for the two big dogs on the stage, Russia and the United States, red lines are a way for them to kind of play mind games with each other because they believe that it would incentivize their enemy to do everything short of a nuclear attack. Chemical weapons, conventional attacks, all these other things that we also wanna deter. So both of them keep their red lines intentionally vague and fuzzy, forcing each other to constantly be questioning, where's the red line? Like, am I going too far? Am I gonna trigger a nuclear strike if I do this or that? This keeps both sides very far away from provoking each other 'cause they're not sure where the red lines are. And this is the mind game at the heart of modern nuclear politics. It's a very dangerous mind game, but it's nonetheless the one we have. - If deterrence ever fails, then you just have this really terrible thing that could affect humanity's long-term survival. (ominous music) - Okay, now time for some payoff. I'm gonna apply this to the real world. We've been doing this kind of like conceptual, theoretical deterrence talk. I'm now going to show you how all of these ingredients and this deterrence plays out in the real world. (soft music) First, Ukraine. - People will say, didn't Western deterrence fail because Russia attacked it all? And I would say, absolutely not. In fact, it is a case study of how nuclear deterrence actually works. - I'm gonna make a list of all the moves and counter moves that these two nuclear powers play on each other. - The day the conflict started, Putin announced that he was putting his nuclear forces on high alert. It didn't quite have the intended effect. So like a few days later, he remade the same announcement. This time he had a photograph taken. That's a nuclear signal. But he meant that specifically for people like me who read that kind of stuff to say, oh, they're serious. I better tell Biden that this is serious. - Russia has shamelessly violated the core tenets of the United Nations Charter. - Putin was very clearly manipulating nuclear risk. He wanted all of Europe to know that Russia had nuclear weapons and they should remember that. - The West immediately responded with sanctions, punishing Russia's economy. But beyond that, there was a big debate. There was some fear, some deterrence. Should we send military troops? Should we send weapons? Maybe just send money? We don't wanna cross Putin's line. - The Russians drew a number of what they wanted us to believe were very clear red lines. If you supply them with mobile artillery, it'll be World War III. - Whoever would try to stop us and further create threats to our country, to our people, should know that Russia's response will be immediate and lead you to such consequences that you have never faced in your history. - See what he's doing here? Like, do you see how vague that language is? It's grand, it's scary, it's not specific. This is a blurry red line that forces the West to fill in the blanks for themselves, to think twice before sending troops or sending support, because what if he's serious? All right, your move, NATO. - Hundreds of thousands of NATO troops on heightened alert. - We're also taking steps to defend our NATO allies, particularly in the East. - Putin's saber-rattling did instill some fear in the West. So instead of sending troops to Ukraine, NATO deployed 40,000 of their troops to the border, just outside of Ukraine. And then the West responded by doing some signaling of their own, saying that the use of nuclear weapons would result in, quote, ""catastrophic consequences for Russia."" - The wind of the conflict sort of blew some sand over the red lines and they got into, turned into pink fuzzy lines that the West eventually started to test and tolerate. - And then the NATO countries do start sending weapons, but they don't send them all at once. They're worried that might cross his line. So they have to calibrate their response and they start sending weapons a little at a time. I mean, it wasn't a little, it was a lot of weapons, but they could have sent way more and it could have actually made a big difference in Ukraine, but they didn't wanna cross his red line. And they don't totally know where it is. - It's like adjusting a thermostat. Like, you don't want the temperature to get too hot. You don't want it to get too cold. Nuclear deterrence deeply frustrated not just the Russians and deeply frustrated the West and frustrated the Ukrainians. And so it's this thing we rely on for security, but it also endlessly, I think, makes the world we inhabit a lot more complicated to maneuver. - Throughout this war, Putin continues issuing nuclear threats. And then he moved some of his nukes to Belarus, another move on the chessboard. He even officially changes Russia's nuclear doctrine, which is like their public facing policy on when they'll use nukes. He changes it to have a lower threshold, like to make it easier for Russia to use nukes. The US is getting ready to send long range missiles to Ukraine so that Ukraine can strike Russia deep into the country. But Putin says that if he does this, it's gonna have big consequences and it actually gives then President Biden some pause. He's deterred for a little bit, being like, ""Am I gonna cross a red line if I send these missiles to Ukraine?"" Eventually the pressure mounted and he did end up sending the long range missiles. Ukraine used them. Russia was angry, but they didn't use nukes. It was once again a bluff. So ultimately, Putin did slow down the West's support, deterred them a little bit with his bluster. - They kind of",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
x, not as effectively as Russia would want. Putin's threats to slow American and Western support in ways that was deeply damaging to Ukraine's defense. But they did have a time limited effect that eventually the West called their bluff. - People will talk about Putin's nuclear blackmail. And like, I'm sorry, I have no love for Vladimir Putin. There is no such thing as nuclear blackmail. It is all nuclear deterrence. What he was doing was practicing nuclear deterrence. We love deterring because it makes our national objectives easier to accomplish. But when the other guy does it to us, it kind of ruins our day and we call it nuclear blackmail. - I mean, listen, Russia and the United States, they've been playing this chess game of red lines and nuclear weapons since the '50s. So it's like, they kind of know each other's red lines. And most experts I talked to were like, yeah, there was a lot of nuclear bluster, but it was a lot of show. It was not actually close to a real strike. That being said, all it takes is one dude having a bad day and getting emotional about his pride and honor to change everything. It's a really fragile, terrifying balance that relies on Vladimir Putin's brain. And during a lot of this, you saw Russian elites and journalists and even policymakers clamoring to use nuclear weapons to reset the credibility. They're like, dude, you're losing the credibility. We're gonna lose the deterrent. Use a small tactical nuke in Ukraine and your credibility will be restored. - A hawkish voice in Moscow is now advocating that Russia should launch a limited nuclear strike. - And certainly Putin considered that. But luckily, sanity prevailed and he didn't do it. So India and Pakistan both have nukes. And this is really the only place where two nuclear powers fight each other directly. India has 172 nukes and they use them not just to deter Pakistan, but also China. For a long time, India did what the big powers do and kept their red lines vague, using that ambiguity to make their neighbors think twice about trying to take any of this disputed territory up in the mountains. But in an effort to influence stability and be a responsible nuclear power, in the early 2000s, they said they were joining China to adopt a no-first-use policy, meaning they won't nuke anyone unless they get nuked first. Now, ironically, some have pointed out that this actually invites attacks up on these borders, as we've seen in recent years. So Pakistan has around 170 nukes as well, but they've opted to keep the vague red line that makes India's much more powerful military think twice before attempting to conquer any of this disputed territory. All right, nuclear deterrence is playing a huge role in Taiwan, where nuclear-armed China is constantly flexing its power as it becomes more and more powerful in the region, but is, inconveniently for them, running into this. This is America's nuclear umbrella in Asia. We call it an umbrella because it covers our allies. It's basically a promise to defend South Korea and Japan if they're ever attacked. And the red lines are pretty clear here. It's a reason why these countries feel safe and why they feel like they don't need to get a nuclear weapon for themselves because the U.S. has their back, okay? They've got a nuclear deterrent protecting them. But Taiwan is different. It is widely seen as like the top place on Earth where a miscalculation could escalate into war between two nuclear powers because China has vowed to take Taiwan. They believe that it's rightfully theirs, it always has been, and that eventually they will take it, even if by force. But deterrence is a major reason why they haven't done so yet. And it's the U.S. that's playing the fuzzy red line game here. If China invades Taiwan, will the U.S. come to its rescue? Who knows? - U.S. forces, U.S. men and women, would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion. - Yes, if in fact there was an unprecedented attack. - Whoa, Biden just said they would, but then, seconds later, the White House retracted that statement and apologized. - The White House is now walking back President Biden's comments on Taiwan. - [Reporter] Officially, the U.S. will not say whether American forces would defend Taiwan. - Blurry red line. Will they protect Taiwan or will they not? Now, the U.S. might be bluffing here. They might actually not be willing to go like send their own troops in to confront China if they invade Taiwan, but they need Beijing to think that they might because that is such a horrifying potential that it will prevent China from attacking in the first place. And that's deterrence. Okay, pan up here to another nuclear chess game of high stakes and irrational minds and fuzzy red lines. - North Korea has the world's lowest realistic threshold, I think, for nuclear weapons used today. - North Korea has got 50 warheads and they actually have a very clear red line. They have stated that if the regime's survival is ever threatened, they will use their nukes. And by the regime, I mean the Kim family, the dictators who've ruled North Korea since its founding. This is a terrifying prospect and they've really made us believe that this is a credible threat. They test their nukes. They're constantly like," """"Dude"," we're ready to attack if you ever get close to trying to overthrow the regime."""" And they easily could. The capital of South Korea is like right there. And as of 2017", they've got rockets that could send a nuclear weapon to the mainland United States. So now they really have a deterrent that gives us pause before doing anything to provoke them. - When you're the president of the United States and you're deciding whether you're gonna run that risk and you're gonna go all the way to Pyongyang and remove Kim from power, knowing that he's got 10 ICBMs that could hit one of your cities, that is not a decision that you make in a cavalier manner. And so that is essentially the mechanism of deterrence. It is as Dr. Strangelove says, it is creating in the mind of your enemy the fear to attack. And that is what Kim Jong-un is trying to do. - They use their nukes to basically ensure the survival and the reign of power of the Kim family. It's like a core part of what keeps them going. And of all the nuclear powers, they weaponize irrationality. I mean, this kind of theater of being like the crazy dictator with his hand on the trigger is a really powerful deterrent. It's a major reason why the US and South Korea and anyone won't get anywhere near the red line. And it forces the United States to grapple with whether or not they would provoke a nuclear attack on their soil to protect South Korea. Deterrence has so far kept the whole thing in this sort of tense, scary balance, but that could change any minute and hopefully it doesn't. (soft music) So can we just stop the nukes, please? Can we as humanity just agree that this is completely irrational, totally insane, that we've invented these things and that we wield them? And can we all just agree that it would be better to not have them at all? Could we? Ooh, I wish, but it's a little more complicated. I mean, 73 countries have signed a treaty saying they'll never develop nukes. Could we just get everyone else to do it? Seems sensible. Unfortunately, most experts I talked to say it's not quite that simple. - Unfortunately, you can't un-invent the technology and actually, sudden disarmament would put you in a much more dangerous position where any country could suddenly leap into a position of massive power by just committing to building lots and lots of nuclear warheads. - We still live in a world where big countries are skeptical of each other. There's no central authority governing everyone. And so countries naturally compete with each other. They're constantly trying to one-up each other to protect themselves and scare their enemy. That is like a natural law of international relations. I hope it's not the case someday 'cause it really, like, our world would be much better if we all just cooperated. But for now, this is how we do it. The current arrangement is that, yes, we do diplomacy and we do some international law, but a major stabilizer for the big empires is everyone having a gun pointed at each other so that no one does anything crazy. It gives way to a bunch of other types of conflict, proxy wars we've talked a lot about on this channel, but for now, it has kept the big powers from going into a full cataclysmic war. - And unfortunately, half of this community just says," """"We need to get rid of all the corporates tomorrow!"""" (yells) And the other half says"," """"No", we need new corporates for everything," including stopping asteroids!"""" (yells) We need everyone to take a deep breath and think strategically and think in the longer term. - So how do we manage this then? During the Cold War", we saw the US and the Soviet Union figure out a way to work together while still having nukes. They could still do the deterrence thing, the credibility, the red lines, all of that, but instead of just constantly one-upping each other, they started to reduce, and that's how we went from having tens of thousands of nukes to just having 12,000 today. What's tricky about this new world we're entering into is that it's not just two powers. - Soviet Union went poof, and we had this moment of global nuclear optimism. Today, it's like all of the dynamics are heading in the wrong direction. We have competitive great power dynamics, we have new entrants like North Korea, we have India and Pakistan innovating in their own way about how they wanna fight wars under the nuclear shadow, and so all of that takes us to a place where, unfortunately, this broader toolkit that we have relied on to render this enterprise of nuclear deterrence somewhat more predictable and manageable for mankind is under great strain. - I think we'll move towards safer, smaller ones. More, I don't know. I mean, I think the US and Russia are gonna stay stable, but it depends on what China does. If China matches them, does Russia feel like they need to be bigger than China? I don't know. And if Russia races, does the US race? And then does this become a congressional thing where we say it has to be US equals Russia plus China plus one? Well, then what happens when North Korea hits 1,000? Or what happens, ah, you know what I mean? Like, if we're racing, and again, because of the asymmetries of all these races, then everybody ends up, do we end up with everybody with 10,000 in these things? I hope not. That, I really think we could have talks to get out of. - China seems to be building their nuclear arsenal very quickly, and they are not telling the world why. - Why is China doing this buildup? Like, that is still being debated. Xi Jinping has not given us a speech, like, telling us why we're seeing more nuclear weapons in China. Imaginations have run wild in Washington a little bit about what China's goals are here. - There was a moment during the Cold War where it got really bad. Cuba, the Cuban Missile Crisis, you've probably heard of it. The closest we ever got to, like, actually going full bore into a nuclear war with the Soviet Union. And that sort of woke everyone up to the insanity. It sort of, like, gave us the picture of how close we were to, like, mass annihilation. And it was that crisis that helped the two countries increase communication lines with each other, put in place some frameworks to, like, make sure that nothing crazy happens. And it really did stabilize the world and eventually led to the reduction of all of these nukes. We're going to need to do that again. Like, we're gonna have to have those conversations again. The question is, is it going to take another scary crisis and a close call to get us there? - What is it we really want? We want peace and stability. We want us all to be able to survive for another generation. How do we do that best? We need to defend ourselves and we need to redevelop the habit of thinking more strategically and diplomacy and talking to our adversaries in order to try to avoid the next conflict and get to somewhere with peace. The hard work needs to happen now. (soft music) - Hey, everyone, thanks for watching. Did you know we have two other channels that we launched?

rvYRifKrS24,The World's Most Ignored War Explained,,News & Journalism,"(intriguing orchestral music) (reporter speaking foreign language) (protestors clamoring) (bullets sputtering) - This place, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, one of the most complex, longest running conflicts in the world, and you're probably not hearing about it much on the news, but it is important, and it is connected to the entire world. It's a war where the front lines are always changing. There's militia, hundreds of them, they control little patches of territory. Let me show you the one map that got me deep into this story. It looks like this. (intriguing dramatic orchestral music) All of these are the groups, the many, many different groups, armed groups, and this is the territory they control, or controlled. This map is totally outdated, because, every day, it shifts. These groups blob together, they break apart, they join alliances with the national army and then with the rebels. (intriguing dramatic orchestral music) This is a war that is funded by minerals, by roadblocks, by illegal taxes, extortion. And in February, 2025, the logic of this war reached Washington, DC. (intriguing dramatic orchestral music) The President of the Congo is offering Congo's vast minerals in exchange for military support to push back Rwanda-backed rebels. These are the kinds of deals Donald Trump loves, and the US is moving forward with, what it calls, ""a path forward"" for a deal. (intriguing dramatic orchestral music) But this video is not about that. That will be on the news, and we'll see where it goes. To me, what's much more interesting is what is going on here? How did it get to look like this, this patchwork of all these different groups? Where's the government in all of this? Well, it turns out the government is actually a part of all of this. (intriguing dramatic music) This isn't just about minerals, it's not just about rebels, it's about power. How power is extracted and sold and traded in a space where a central government does not control or have a monopoly on violence, like in most countries. And it's all happening in this country that is much bigger than you think. At least it was much bigger than I thought. - Congo's a continent of a country, it's as large as all of Western Europe combined. (intriguing dramatic orchestral music) - Congo is home to tens of trillions of dollars of untapped mineral resources. I mean, we cover a lot of wars on this channel, but this one's different. If you watch our videos, you'll see a lot of maps with icons, this group versus that group, sometimes it's like four different groups, sometimes it gets really complex. We make icons to represent these different groups. But for this one, we can't really do that, and I wanted to understand why. - There's something about the nature of modern conflict we're describing that is not what most people are probably familiar with. They see maps where Ukraine is versus Russia, or Hamas is versus Israel, and what we see here is a much more fractal kinds of conflict, which is actually much more common than those conflicts I just said. - That's Jason Stearns, he's like world expert on this topic, and he will help us navigate this very complicated, difficult to understand, conflict. So let's dive into this conflict, the context, the background, and how it got to look like this, how it's lasted decades, how it's reshaped itself over and over again, and how the sides aren't trying to take over the country? They're just trying to extract value from it. And it turns out that war can be very valuable, especially when you add to the equation what's beneath the ground, and the power that comes with controlling people and land and movement. (intriguing dramatic orchestral music) (intriguing orchestral music) Now the roots of the story, of course, start with Europeans carving up Africa. We covered that pretty extensively in our ""How Europe Stole the World"" series. So if you wanna deep dive, go there. But why don't we start here. This image that we've sort of doctored up to make it a little bit more immersive. This is European leaders inventing countries in Africa in the late 1800s, carving up this map looking for resources. And the Congo was one of the many inventions of Europeans. - Congo was created actually as the private fiefdom of a Belgian king in 1885. And so, the whole purpose of the Congolese state was always to extract from the local population. It was never to create a government or a state that provides public services or public goods, including security. - The Belgians mapped it and discovered just how many valuable resources the place had. The most valuable at the time was rubber, and it led to one of the most brutal colonial exploitation campaigns in history. - It's got an enormous amount of natural resources. Congo is geological scandal is what Congolese call it. It's the largest producer of copper in Africa, it's the largest producer of cobalts, it's one of the largest producers of diamonds, tungsten, tantalum, tin. You go down the lists, they have it. The uranium used for Hiroshima, Nagasaki came from the Congo. In fact, a lot of Belgium's wealth came from Congo's mines. (intriguing dramatic orchestral music) - Again, go watch part three of that series if you want a deeper dive. So the most important part of this section of the story is that Belgium didn't build a country out of Congo. They built a pipeline for resources to Europe. (enthralling orchestral music) (train whirring) The roads and railways led from mines and plantations to ports, not between cities. It created ethnic groups and tribal identities, and then played them off each other, so that they could conquer them. But, also, in the process, sowing the seeds for future conflict and division. - That deep history really is important in understanding where we are today, because a lot of the habits, and the trends, and the logics of the state is sort of persistence of today. - Some of the structural issues Congo is still facing, moving from bad governance, the structured army, lack of a sustainable policy, that is actually where we can situate some of these trends. (enthralling orchestral music) - Hey, real quick, let me tell you about Threat Protection and these new tools coming out of NordVPN who is the sponsor of today's video. I'm very grateful that they sponsor our journalism. I started using a VPN like years ago now. Originally, when I would travel, I would connect to the internet via the United States, which is what a VPN allows you to do. And for a lot of years, that was the big perk, like I wouldn't get kicked out of my Gmail or something if I was in another country, with some like security two-factor death loop. But since then, Nord has become a much more useful tool. I've recently been learning how vulnerable we all can be when we are surfing the internet on public Wi-Fi, like, when I'm in a coffee shop or a hotel or whatever. When you're connected to Nord, your internet traffic is secure, it's encrypted. It's one of many perks you get as a part of their threat protection suite of tools. This blocks malware and phishing attempts, annoying ads. It generally makes being on the internet safer, which, like, cyber attacks are getting weirdly sophisticated. So I feel good when I'm connected to NordVPN. And it just happens in the background, like it's not like I don't have to like type anything in it, it just is in the background, doesn't mess with my speed. Oh, and I can watch streaming shows from other countries when I connect to other countries, which is kind of sick. Anyway. So I'm a big fan of NordVPN, it's really affordable, and they're giving a discount to anyone who uses the link in my description, it is nordvpn.com/johnnyharris. When you sign up for the 2 Year Plan, you get four extra months for free, and there's a 30 day money back guarantee, so you can get all your money back if it's not a good fit for you. So nordvpn.com/johnnyharris, clicking the link helps support the channel, gets you in on that discount. Thank you NordVPN for sponsoring today's video. And with that, let's get back to the DRC. (enthralling dramatic orchestral music) Let's now fast forward to modern day where the Democratic Republic of the Congo is a independent country. It's one that is shaped by a lot of conflict, especially in the '90s. It's also shaped by what happened next door in the '90s, in Rwanda, where a civil war and genocide led to the fleeing of millions into the Congo. Some of them gathered together as anti-Rwanda rebel groups. All of this leading to what became known as The Great War of Africa. (enthralling dramatic orchestral music) Okay, again, we're not gonna get into Africa's World War, it's a huge thing, but just look at the map of this war. It did turn into a complex web of actors, some allying with the Congolese government, some being backed by foreign governments, I mean there was a lot of players in this war. But it's still not this, this fractured group that we're eventually going to explain. The big difference is that the goal for these groups during the big war in the '90s was to win, was to take over the government, winning power of the state. I mean, that's how most civil wars are, one side wants to take over the government. Okay, but here's something you don't see on this map, and it's very important for how we get to the fractured group. There are actually tons of small militias in a bunch of different villages in this region. Over the years, a lot of small self-defense forces formed militias that were meant to protect villages in the absence of a functioning state. - There were self-defense groups that had emerged, in part because the state had collapsed. - Again, these aren't rebel groups, these aren't political groups, these are just people trying to protect their community. They're like their local police force. (intriguing dramatic orchestral music) So keep that in mind, the self-defense forces that each community has, they'll become important in just a second. This big war ends in 2003, and all the different groups come to a peace deal. There's elections, democracy tries to sprout, and it fails. (intriguing dramatic music) After one of the groups loses in elections, they flee to the east and form a new rebellion, widely believed to be backed by Rwanda. So it's like the early 2000s and the DRC is headed towards another full-blown civil war. - Now, the Congolese government at that point was a weak government, it had just emerged out of a war, its army was hodgepodge of different armed groups thrown into one joint army. And so, they really didn't have much of an army to push back against this new rebellion. - This moment is crucial for understanding what happens next. You got the rebels, you got the DRC, government that is super weak, they don't have a super cohesive army. So who do they turn to but these dozens and dozens of small community self-defense militias, the ones I was talking about earlier, like local police force for these communities, they turn to them, they say, ""You're fighters, help us counter this rebellion. We will give you weapons and support."" - ""In addition to our army, let's just pump weapons and ammunition into all of these local militia in the Eastern Congo."" - So the state funnels weapons into the eastern DRC to help them fight back the rebels. And in the short term, it kind of worked. The Congolese government achieved what it wanted to, halting the advance of the rebels. And, eventually, in 2009, this kind of reemergence of a civil war was ended in a peace deal that was brokered by Rwanda. But remember all the guns and ammunition that the government sent to the small defense forces? Yeah, that's still there. - A flush with weapons, mostly old Soviet-era weapons, so Kalashnikovs. (intriguing dramatic orchestral music) - These groups are now more armed and more hardened by war, and these small defense militias now see an opportunity for more power and for growth. - The big reason of why there's so many and why they're so prevalent is because of a lack of kind of a security footprint from the Congolese state. It's kinda like the Wild West out in Eastern Congo that, if you wanna provide security, isn't gotta be on a village by village basis, which is how these are all kind of springing up. - Moving around some of the very remote villages, farmers were still not aware that former President Kabila had died. There is a sort of disconnection from locals, especially in remote areas, to peri-urban and urban centers. - And so, here we are at the explanation of why we have so many armed groups in the Eastern Congo. But do you see how this is different than the typical civil war that we cover on the channel, and that you usually think about when you think about a civil war? This isn't as political. - These are now a hundred different armed groups spread over an area, roughly the size of California, whose goal is not to take the state, they're too weak to take the state. Their goal is basically just to survive and to extract whatever resources they can extract. A generation of fighters who all they know how to do is fight. - When you have absence of states, people will refer to them as their protectors. - War becomes a mean of survival, becomes a mean of dignity. That's the origin of this fragmentation. (intriguing dramatic orchestral music) - Congo's really kind of got this rainbow of individuals here as far as what group looks like what. They'll come across very professionally, you know, camouflage and full fatigues, well-equipped. And then, in contrast, you'll see some of these groups and they're obviously much poorer equipped, I mean, these guys aren't running around in fatigues, but they have, you know, rain boots and soccer jerseys on and just carrying around beat up AK. (intriguing dramatic orchestral music) (enthralling orchestral music) - So this gets us closer to what it looks like today, and why this war continues. There's no front line, there's no single enemy. So the question is, what do these groups want? What is their goal? - Almost every single armed group, if you go and talk to them in the Eastern Congo, they'll say, ""We're here to protect our people."" But if you go and talk to those people, they'll tell you, ""Well, that's how they started off as, and, yes, those are our sons and our nephews and whatnot, but now, these guys are not here to protect us."" Almost every single armed group, almost by necessity, because they need to feed themselves, they recruit sometimes forcefully, they extract, they tax, and they become predatory. And so, you have this transition from local self-protection groups really to extract to this, to groups. - Everyone keeps saying that they tax people. Taxing is what a government does to its people to run the government. So what do they mean by tax? Well, this takes us back to the resources and the minerals that lie beneath Congo's soil. You got some diamonds, not a ton, but it's mostly tungsten, tantalum, tin, and perhaps most valuable and abundant in these mines, gold. (enthralling traditional music) We're making a whole video about gold, just gold, everything gold. Because, in researching this piece and reporting out the global supply chain and trade of gold, I became endlessly fascinated with the stuff. Much like everyone in history, gold is this insanely magical, weird, crazy thing, and we're making a whole video about it. So, expect that some time in coming months. Okay, but before we go any further, let's clear something up. 'Cause the way that this is reported, all the conflict in Eastern Congo, the way that it's usually reported by media outlets is blood gold, conflict minerals, there's a conflict in Congo, and it's all about minerals. As you will see, that is a part of the story, but it is not the whole thing. It goes far beyond minerals. - That is part of the motives, but it does not justify or explain the overall scope around armed groups, militia, or self defense initiatives implementation. - These groups will ""tax"" anything they can; cattle, charcoal, cassava, market stalls, some guy on a motorbike. And this one report was titled, ""Everything that moves will be taxed."" - Whoever is perceived as a protector, meaning an authority, then they are rightful to perceive or to fix, to put in place taxation. And recently, we noticed that some armed groups were now easily collecting taxes, like nobody could thought of, an armed group delivering a building license, yet it is happening now. - And I will show you what those taxes look like in just a sec, but let's get back to gold, because, even though gold isn't the root or the main driver of the conflict, it is a huge part of how the war economy works, how these groups are funded, and how this stuff is connected to the global economy. (enthralling orchestral music) So all these dots, look at all of these dots. Every one of these dots represents a gold mine. This is very difficult data to get your hands on, and the International Peace Information Service are the group that collected this. They do incredible work and have generously helped us in providing their data and expertise for this story. I would not be able to tell this story without those on the ground collecting data. Okay, so you've got all these gold mines, but look what happens next. (enthralling dramatic orchestral music) These are the armed groups that we talked about, the ones that started as self-defense groups, and then got a bunch of weapons and ammunition from the government to help stave off the rebels, and now use that firepower to make money off of a lot of things, including, as we see on this map, gold mines. (enthralling dramatic orchestral music) - It's the perfect economy for the mafia really, right? What does the mafia provide? The mafia provides two things. The mafia provides financing, it has good access to huge amounts of money, and it provides protection. And for something like gold, which you have, if you're a gold digger in the Eastern Congo, and you have 50 grams of gold to sell, that's an enormous amount of money in the middle of nowhere. And so, you need protection, and you need somebody to buy it, you need financing. And so, these are very easily militarized sectors. (enthralling dramatic orchestral music) - So let's get really specific now, so we can see what this looks like. Let's zoom into one of these mines, so I can show you how these local turf wars work, how this war economy works, how this gold flows from a hill in Eastern Congo to the international markets. (intriguing orchestral music) And along the way, we will see how all these armed groups and the government have built some version of ""violent order,"" half war, half cooperation, all happening in a space where the government is at once totally absent, but also, as you'll see, very present, but in a way that you might not think. (intriguing dramatic orchestral music) - You have millions of people digging for tin, tungsten, and mostly gold, actually. (enthralling dramatic orchestral music) - [Johnny] This is a pit mined, or artisanal mined. - [Jason] This is thousands of young men digging in hillsides, sometimes in terrible conditions, in lots of different pits. They're all, they're dotting mostly very remote hillsides in the Eastern Congo. - [Johnny] They work in these harsh conditions, often with little more than shovels, pans, sometimes bare hands, pulling gold from the soil. - These are fairly militarized pits. You'll find soldiers, they'll provide quote-unquote ""protection and security"" in exchange for payments. - This is unrefined gold. So it's extracted, maybe it's powder or flakes or a small nugget, and then it starts its journey towards the city. But this journey will cross through the territory of dozens of different groups. - Roadblocks are one feature of the landscape of the Congo, and there are thousands of them. - Roadblocks are everything. So one of these armed groups has a roadblock, and they demand a cut from anyone transporting minerals. (enthralling dramatic orchestral music) If you know the system well, and you're well-connected, you have relationships, that will help you with these transactions, ensure that they don't get violent. - Go into a little hut, and you give them what is expected. There'll be some negotiating back and forth, but you pretty much know what you're gonna have to settle for, they'll get some of that. - Now, again, I wanna emphasize, this doesn't just happen for gold. You can be stopped for anything. You can be stopped for carrying cattle, you may have to pay just to move through the checkpoint. Again, ""Everything that moves will be taxed."" - There could be 50 or 60 of these roadblocks before you get to a major city. - A motorcycle could be taxed a few bucks to pass. If you're a big truck, maybe you're taxed $700 for a single checkpoint. And according to the people we talked to, a lot of these transactions happen without violence, it's the threat of violence that keeps the order going out here where there is no government. Wait a minute, but look, that is a soldier. That is an official Congolese military soldier, like, from the government military. And this is where it starts to get even more kind of mind bending on our normal boxes and categories and frameworks for understanding conflict. Turns out that the government military is very present out here. (enthralling dramatic orchestral music) They move around in this system, they have roadblocks of their own, and they end up behaving very similarly to these armed groups. They set up checkpoints, they extract illegal informal taxes, they'll pocket some of them, or they will distribute them, not to the state coffers, but to their network of alliances and relationships, which could include other armed groups, or local police, or even commanders back in the Capitol who want in on all of this. And, again, what you start to see is a kind of quasi-order where there is a equilibrium of the tax rate, the same that the Congolese government would impose if they were out here, but now it's an armed group, or a Congolese soldier, that's sort of acting like an armed group, but also technically works for the government, but doesn't get paid very much, so they subsidize their pay by setting up a checkpoint to make more money, like... You start to see that all of these power systems, none of them are strong enough to command the whole state and to impose order, and so, they fracture, and they all end up grabbing what they can. - If you are a peasant in the Eastern Congo and your day-to-day job is farming cassava and beans, two staple crops in eastern DRC, then you have to get them to market. Chances are, if you take them to market, you'll run into a roadblock met by people with guns, you have to pay taxes to them. If you don't pay taxes to them, they could get violent. And so, abuse and violence is part of day-to-day life. Funerals are, I mean, it's a very social world, and so, it's rare that several months go by without there being a funeral. And so, death and violence are things that are just much more present. (enthralling dramatic orchestral music) - So we're gonna get back to our journey of gold from the mine to the global market, but, first, let me just drive this point home by going back to our map. (intriguing orchestral music) Remember these are the dots that are gold mines, these are the local armed groups, and these dots are instances where between 2021 and 2023, the military of the Democratic Republic of the Congo was reported to be interfering, which basically means showing up with roadblocks or showing up to pit mines and threatening violence and demanding payment, not for the government, but for themselves and their alliances. Again, thank you IPIS for this data. - Violence permeates life. Most of the population knows nothing but war. - We grew up as children, kids, who only knew violence and war. Growing as a child, I think you don't actually perceive that as something that's appealed to you. And as I said, people somehow some ways rationalize that as a way of living. - But at the same time, they know how to navigate these wars and these press, they know how to deal with soldiers, they know what the logic is of violence. (intriguing orchestral music) - [Johnny] Okay, we're back to the truck that's driving, it's passing through all of these checkpoints, these roadblocks. (enthralling dramatic orchestral music) Once you've made it through the checkpoints, maybe 60 of them, so the gold makes it to the border, and it's almost always smuggled across. Gold is very small, you can put it in your pocket, and walk across the border. - Well, they'll be walking across the border. Sometimes that would be official border and they just hide that on their person. - And it mostly goes to either Rwanda or Uganda, this is where it gets refined. There's this one Belgian businessman who has been convicted of money laundering. He's on the sanction list for the U.S. Treasury for contributing to armed conflicts and illicit trade in the DRC region. He owns one of Africa's largest gold refineries, it's in Uganda, and it processes a lot of this smuggled gold that comes from this conflict region. Uganda's gold exports were about a half a million dollars in 2014. In 2023, not even 10 years later, they jumped to $2.3 billion. A lot of that's coming from the war economy next door. - Global markets needs at a lower cost, some of the minor roles that can be found in Congo. And multinationals have tested and saw it working to get what they needed out of Congo through local armed groups rather than dealing directly with the central government. And so, they perpetrate that. - Same thing happens in Rwanda. If the gold is smuggled across the border in Rwanda, it goes to a refinery that is owned and operated by Rwanda's army. And then, once it's refined... - It's put on an airplane, and it goes to Dubai. (enthralling dramatic orchestral music) - We are now out of the checkpoints, and artisanal mines, and threats of violence, and in the gleaming city built off of oil, which is the epicenter of gold. It's one of the world's major gold hubs, tax free, strategically located here at the center of the globe. A huge amount of the gold, especially coming from the DRC and a bunch of other regions in Africa, including a bunch that fund this war economy, come to the United Arab Emirates, who doesn't ask very many questions. Instead, they combine it with all the other gold, it's washed clean of all of its conflict blood, and it's sold off to the world. The origins disappear, the corruption is polished away into a universally desired store of value, impossible to trace. - It goes into jewelry, some of it goes into industrial manufacturing, a gold is still used for coating in electronics and other things, and some of it is used for laundering money by gold. And all of a sudden, you know, like magic, your dirty money becomes clean money, because it's gold now, right? It's very opaque, once it reaches Dubai. - This gold disappears again into Dubai, into Russia, again, into the EU, to push for the minerals and the resources that are in this region are absolutely massive. And, again, you know, it's everything for electric cars to satellites. I mean, there's a lot of money involved in this, and they're a massive exporter. (enthralling dramatic orchestral music) (intriguing orchestral music) - Okay, but let's get back to the Congo, because I'm less interested in gold, although, I'm really interested in gold, and I'll make an entire video about it, and I'm more interested in what keeps this system going. This system of artisanal mines with soldiers, hundreds and hundreds of checkpoints, military soldiers that work for the government, but also behave like armed militias that are extorting people at every turn, the threat of violence that breaks out and ends up destroying the lives of the locals at a moment's notice. And I wanted to understand what keeps it going. This system has been going on for decades, just like this. It turns out that this eternal war economy produces a lot of value, mostly for the warlords and power brokers and government officials that are in on it, but also somewhat paradoxically, this provides a sense of, albeit violent, stability and security for the people. It brings a lot of money to the region. - You know, it's a double-edged sword. It also provides enormous value to local societies. Does it fuel violence? Yes, absolutely. I think that ambiguous nature of the mining sector is not something that many people have been able to grapple with. When, for example, under President Obama, they passed the Conflict Minerals Acts in 2010, it led to a temporary boycott of minerals in the Eastern Congo, and it created an enormous amount of hardship and a resentment towards the United States by people digging in these mines. (enthralling dramatic orchestral music) - So the war economy in the Eastern Congo is not going away anytime soon, and especially because, recently, in addition to these local turf wars that is fueled by minerals and a global gold trade, the regional proxy dynamics, where outside countries start to meddle in bigger ways, are back in full force. - [Reporter] After a bloody invasion, M23 rebels now in full command in the city of Goma. (firearm banging) - So Rwanda has invaded the Eastern Congo and backed arm groups in the Eastern Congo on five occasions, right? And so, these are pattern that goes back almost 30 years now. Rwanda considers the eastern DRC as part of its sphere of influence, much like Israel and Southern Lebanon, much like Pakistan and Southern Afghanistan. Last week, Rwandan government newspaper announced that $1.5 billion of gold had been exported from Rwanda in 2024. The entire Rwandan budget is $4 billion. That is an enormous amount of money, and it's difficult to say that doesn't play a role. I am sure it plays some sort of a role. So I think there's a bunch of different factors, I think it'll be misleading to boil it down to one factor. (enthralling dramatic orchestral music) The story of the Congo has been a dismembering and dilapidation of the state since it was first created. The state was a predator when it was created by the colonial enterprise in 1885, and it's remained so really since its creation. - These are the same communities that are destructed, because kids that are born within these communities, they see this as a model, that is the only model they have been exposed to. - And so long as you have a state that's really invested in violence, I mean, the Congolese elites are also invested in violence for a whole host of different reasons, as long as you have that, it's hard for me to see neighboring countries will continue to meddle, multinational corporations will continue to profit. So I think really what you have is inelectable state, really. You have to go back to the state that would be able to provide the most basic of goods, which is security. And so, I think that's the foremost challenge for this generation. It's really a generational challenge, it's not something that can be fixed quickly. And I think it will not come from outsiders. I mean, from what I've seen in the Congo over almost three decades is those people are there, they're ready to build, you just need to give 'em space to do that. (pedestrian speaking foreign language) - Hey, everyone, thanks for watching. This video was different in some ways, because this is an area that is an information vacuum. That's why I'm really grateful to our sources who helped us get insight into what's happening here. If you have unique insight, whether local or professional, or whatever, in this region or anywhere else that is an information vacuum, I'd like to know about it, 'cause I wanna report more on these parts of the world that are not paid attention to as much, and are harder to report on, because they are shrouded in conflict, or are remote, or difficult to understand or whatever. That's something I'm very interested in. So, please, leave comments, reach out, and thank you all for watching, for being here. And I'm going to make this video on gold, like, what is your questions about gold? Tell me everything you want to know about gold, its history, the chemical properties of gold, how it's used in medical treatments? Like, gold is an endless rabbit hole that I plan to descend into, and I would love to know what you're curious about. Okay, that's it, thank you so much for being here, and I'll see you in the next one.

Om3IQ5HEQ8g,The Logistics of Music Festivals,,News & Journalism,"This is the Glastonbury Festival… or at least,  it will be. Right now it’s a dairy farm,   set in the Somerset countryside, home to about 400  cows. Through fall, winter, and spring they graze   the fields for grass and shrubs, in turn producing  milk that’s used to make Worthy Farm Cheddar. But   come late-April, it’s time for them to relocate  to their summer residence at a nearby farm.   That’s because these fields are about to be  transformed into the largest greenfield music   festival in the entire world—in a matter  of weeks, 200,000 people will descend onto   this farm in the middle of nowhere Britain.  First, they block off access—there are a number   of roads and footpaths running through it which  of course need to become private as construction   begins. Next, the perimeter fence goes up, along  with the very first facility: a preliminary site   office from which the construction processes will  be led. Before construction begins, though, they   need to address the roads. Most of them are made  of dirt meaning in Britain’s rainy weather, with   a large number of heavy vehicles, they’d quickly  become impassable. That’s why they lay down these   temporary metal road coverings rated for up to  40 tonnes. There’s also the matter of bridges.   There are a number across the site and small  farm bridges were never designed to accommodate   a constant barrage of semi-trucks, so while many  have been permanently upgraded through the years   to handle the demand, others get temporarily  reinforced just for the festival period.   Around mid-May, the core stage of the build  begins, so the site office gets supplemented   with shower and toilet facilities so that staff  can camp on-site. Across the following weeks,   this staff headquarters will continue  to grow—they’ll add a first aid center,   a welfare center with mental health and conflict  resolution support, a staff canteen with three   hot meals a day, even a number of crew bars.  The bulk of the build-work involves erecting   around 90 major temporary structures,  ranging from tents to stages. What this   looks like from the perspective of Glastonbury  Festival Events Limited—the actual organizing   company—is facilitating the work of a huge number  of subcontractors who do the operational work of   erecting each facility. Their staff does  little themselves beyond, well, organize.   As this occurs, work starts to build the core  infrastructure of the event. Sanitation is of   paramount importance—200,000 people is a lot, and  if there are not enough places for them to go,   they’ll find their own places to do their  business. Glastonbury’s sanitation solution   would be described by some as innovative  and by others as horrific. Basically,   they dig giant pits in the ground. They then  install what’s called a long-drop toilet—a   row of toilet seats on top of holes that drop  into the bigger hole. The “innovation” is that   the large hole is big enough that it doesn’t have  to be emptied during the festival. Worthy Farm’s   roads are massively congested during the festival,  so having to have trucks constantly make their   way through to empty out Porta Potties would be  quite detrimental to broader festival operations.   Rather, they clean the pits out just once at the  end of the festival, then refill the hole with   dirt and allow residual waste to biodegrade. Of course it’s not all about outputs—there are   also the inputs. The festival includes about 1,000  different traders—food vendors, craft stalls,   charity tents, and more. Now, of course, it would  be chaos if each and every one of these vendors   had to be entirely self-sufficient—each  stall would operate its own generator,   you’d have propane canisters strewn all over the  place, and the single-use plastics consumption   would fly firmly in the face of the festival’s  eco-conscious mission. That’s why Glastonbury   essentially operates its own utility system.  While Worthy Farm looks like a farm and operates   as a farm, the fact that the festival was founded  by the farm’s owners—who still own it to this   day—made it practical to build some permanent  infrastructure. The most notable example of this   is its water supply system. Underneath the fields  is a network of pipes, similar to that underneath   any town, distributing water to key facilities.  This has existed for decades, but the trouble   was that demand over festival weekend was so much  more than traditionally needed in the area—about   3 million liters a day compared to typical demand  of just a half million in the adjacent village.   Naturally, that demand spike strained the local  water mains and led to low pressure for nearby   residents. They complained that they were unable  to do their laundry or take a shower during the   festival, which wasn’t just annoying—it was  a risk to the festival itself. When community   sentiment goes down, so too does the likelihood  of getting an operating permit. As a fix,   the festival experimented with trucking water  in using tankers and filling massive bladders   that would feed into the pipes, but while this  alleviated the water pressure issues it still led   to community impact due to the nonstop procession  of trucks snaking through small village streets.   So eventually they built two massive underground  reservoirs. Today, in the weeks leading up to the   festival, these are slowly filled at a rate that  does not stress the local system, and they have   enough capacity to cover festival weekend without  creating exceptional demand on the local system.  The other utilities are provided by third-party  contractors—the festival requires that all traders   buy propane from the company Festival Gas which  operates regular deliveries throughout the site.   Meanwhile, another company called Aggreko builds  a temporary electric grid for the festival,   using a combination of large generators and  renewable sources, and traders contract directly   with them for their power supply more or less  how they would with a traditional grid operator.   This is only the start of the rules  imposed on vendors by the festival.   Each one of them is an independent business, but  they’re perceived by attendees as a component of   the overall experience, and therefore Glastonbury  is accountable for them and their actions. That’s   why they all have their binder: a huge  collection of paperwork on which their   ability to keep operating hinges. While exact  requirements will vary, in 2015, it looked   like this—vehicle and staff passes, proof of  insurance, health and safety documentation,   even their very own A5 No Smoking sign.  But the vendors, for their part, have had   plenty of time to prepare this documentation  along with their staffing plan, exact footprint   and layout of their space, and all the other  minutiae required as the application window   opens some nine months prior, with selection being  made three months prior to the festival. Selection   takes such a long time because a festival is not  just trying to fill the openings, they’re trying   to fill the openings with vendors that match the  festival’s particular values and particular needs.   From the nonprofit and jewelry tents, to those  making greasy late-night meals or morning-after   breakfasts, vendors inform the experience of a  festival just as much as the art and music, so   the Glastonbury planners pour over each and every  detailed application. And should a vendor get in,   they’ll be paying for the privilege. While  exact fees to trade at Glastonbury aren’t   listed because each is case by case, sizable  and well-positioned food vendors have reported   prices in the 15-to-20,000-pound range for  the busier spaces nearer to major stages,   with rates dropping the farther one is  positioned from the festival center.   A telling sign that the hefty upfront fee  for a five-day run is worthwhile, though,   is a particular feature that appears in  small print on the Glastonbury map—the   wholesale market. Essentially, it’s a shop for  the shops. Each morning of the festival there’s   a procession toward this spot as wholesalers  bring in staple ingredients, fresh foods,   and serveware for the depleted vendors to  purchase. Much of these interactions take   place in the morning when the festival grounds  are generally quieter and easier to navigate.   For a small window of time, a slew of trucks  and tractors are permitted to run deliveries   around the site very slowly and carefully. But  for most, supplies are purchased and then hauled   by hand or wagon to get ready for the next rush.     Staying in stock is critical for vendors and   the festival alike, as a vendor is required to  station their booth at their assigned spot for   the entire run of the festival—as leaving early  would mean a significant fine and lost chance   to come back next year. In part, this is down  to security, as the vendor areas, or markets,   function effectively as islands sealed off from  the general admission areas. Booths, therefore,   are impermeable extensions of fences, each  keeping the festival public outside the   market zone where vendors have their vehicles and  extra supplies, and in some cases, where there are   vendor-only services and camping areas.  Even separated from general admission,   running a vendor at a festival is a draining  affair. The lines at some hours will be unruly   and never-ending, and at other times, nonexistent.  The heat will be sweltering, and there will also   be unrelenting rain. All the while there will  be pressure—pressure to move enough product to   justify the entry fee, pressure to make enough  to keep a food truck up and running for the next   few weeks until another festival, and pressure to  adhere to food safety standards—the last of which,   the festival is also keeping tabs on. To help wrangle Glastonbury’s vendors,   the festival deploys managers with offices  placed near groupings of markets to ensure   policies are being respected by the vendors and  guests and offering themselves as a resource   should anything start going sideways between the  two parties. These Market Managers report to the   Partnership Director, who is responsible for  dealing with all the external partnerships—from   fencing contractors to food vendors—and  operates from the Event Control Center,   which in 2015 was located here at the Green Barn.  Beyond market management, much of the overall   security and safety structures that the festival  relies on emanates from the Event Control Center.   At its busiest, it will see some 500 employees  and volunteers working in and around it, while   representatives of each aspect of the festival  will be based out of it for the festival's   entirety—such as the Operations Director,  Infrastructure Manager, Security Director,   Site Manager, and Health and Safety Coordinator  to name a few. Directly neighboring the control   center is fire control and a makeshift police  station, the former supplied by the regional   Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service.  Connected by phone, radio, and CCTV, the Event   Control Center keeps close tabs on everything  from impending weather and conditions across the   ground to the flow of guests and density of crowds  all with the aim to monitor pending problems and   proactively gameplan solutions. And to make sure  nothing is missed, and response can be hastened   when problems do arise, the directors and managers  stationed at the control center work with official   Area Organizers spread across all areas of the  festival—from stages to campgrounds. It’s this   group that will supervise the buildout of their  region, carry out daily inspections, and manage   adherence on everything from health and safety  standards to the onsite traffic management plan.   Of course, keeping a festival running smoothly  and safely during it requires ample foresight   before it. A campground, for instance,  can be well monitored by area organizers,   accounted for by police, and aided by a robust  lost-and-found system, but crime and petty theft   are things that a good festival addresses  long before the festival. At Glastonbury,   campgrounds are modestly lit by strung-up festoon  lighting to minimize crime in the dark of night,   while each camp will have lock-up areas for  campers' valuables. In such a chaotic environment,   the best way to solve problems is  to limit them in the first place.   The same goes with crowd dynamics—crowd control  procedures only really work when officials have a   good sense as to the exact number of participants  they’re dealing with. As a generally free-spirited   venture from the beginning, Glastonbury has always  dealt with its fair share of gatecrashers. In its   history, the festival has even welcomed them—a  past that has created a culture of seemingly   good-natured trespassing. But that changed with  this fence. Running 5 miles or 8 kilometers   around the festival’s perimeter, the Super  Fortress Fence, as it’s called, has helped the   festival ensure a right-sized crowd by minimizing  intrusions with its smooth 12-foot tall face and   45-degree overhang at the top. Still, some will  try it, so spread across the festival are guard   towers and patrols on motorized vehicles to watch  for those trying to sneak over, or under, the   massive fence. Perhaps countering the festival’s  traditionally welcoming ethos, the fence is a   safety necessity because letting in thousands of  unaccounted-for guests will strain resources and   alter crowd dynamics to a potentially dangerous  extent. And it’s also a licensing necessity,   as this fence came into being in 2002 in response  to a 15,000-pound fine for having gatecrashers   take the crowd size well over the licensed  capacity. Without a far more aggressive system   of keeping people out, Glastonbury was facing  the potential of losing its license entirely.      Now, organizing a festival like Glastonbury  once is, in and of itself, a massive feat,   but doing a festival like Glastonbury year  in year out is yet more impressive because   it not only has to function, it has to function  well. What’s at risk is not just losing business,   but losing the festival’s right to operate at  all. There’s no inherent right for Glastonbury   to operate. If things go wrong, it risks  losing this: its operating permit. And   making Glastonbury’s operations yet more  challenging is the fact that it has to   do all of this in a quiet, sparsely-populated  rural area of famously bureaucratic Britain.   An endless array of regulations are imposed  on the festival by both the local and national   government. Perhaps the biggest risk-area, in the  government’s eyes, centers around alcohol. It’s   of course in the festival’s financial interest  to sell as much alcohol as possible, but too   much drunken debauchery can and has turned music  festivals into riots. Therefore, the UK government   prohibits certain activities that it deems likely  to promote excessive consumption. For example,   the venue must monitor to assure patrons are  not pouring alcohol into other people’s mouths,   and the festival is prohibited from running  drinking games that involve consuming a certain   amount of alcohol in a certain amount of time.  But the government isn’t the only entity the   festival is answerable to. Just as significant a  risk is that of upsetting their insurers. You see,   festivals are incredibly risky businesses, but  they’re also massive businesses. Glastonbury is   estimated to earn upwards of $80 million a year  in revenue, but that revenue all hinges on just   five core days of operation. If weather washes it  out or key artists fail to show or reality doesn’t   match expectations, Glastonbury will likely have  to refund ticket-sales—either due to government   regulations or public pushback. Of course, almost  all of the expenses—contractors, tent rentals,   infrastructure, staff salaries—will have already  been paid for. It’s not like a traditional   concert-venue where a year-round schedule offsets  the risk of individual shows—here, all their eggs   are in one basket. Without insurance, one rainy  weekend could bankrupt the business, and even   without foul weather the festival might struggle  to hire contractors and artists due to concern   about nonpayment in the event of cancellation.  So insurance is effectively mandatory. Almost any   large festival will hold a massive policy covering  both general liability and more unique risks like   event cancellation and artist non-appearance.  Very few insurers—reportedly about ten—will   actually underwrite these policies given  their massive scale, giving them quite a   bit of leverage in setting terms. Every policy  is unique, but much of the design and operations   of festivals is therefore dictated by the  insurer—for liquor liability coverage they   might require that sales are limited to two  at a time, for general liability coverage they   might set security staffing minimums, for artist  non-appearance coverage they might prohibit the   festival from booking particularly troublesome  artists, for event cancellation coverage they   might require an on-site meteorologist.  But while these insurance policies make   event management a sustainable business,  they are also now holding the industry back.   Many of these policies did cover cancellation due  to communicable diseases, meaning the insurers   lost a colossal amount of money in 2020 due to the  COVID pandemic. Five years on, it’s still almost   impossible to get a policy covering pandemics, at  least at a reasonable cost, but even the policies   excluding it have inflated in cost. There have  been a number of high-profile incidents that   likely involved high-dollar payouts in recent  years like the deadly Astroworld crowd crush.   And then on top of that, there’s a global trend of  increased extreme weather. Just as this is pushing   up home insurance rates in fire-prone areas, it’s  also raising the cost of festival insurance.   Combined, there are instances like the Bonnaroo  festival, in Tennessee, which cancelled in 2020   due to COVID, 2021 due to flooding, and 2025 due  to heavy rains. With three cancellations in six   years, it’s no wonder insurance rates are going  up. Bonnaroo is owned by Live Nation which, due to   its scale, can likely negotiate lower rates as its  risk is diversified over many different festivals,   but the impacts are more pronounced for  independent festivals like Glastonbury   where the risk is more singular. And insurance  issues are greatest for new festivals. Insurers   charge higher rates when a festival is unproven,  which makes it exceptionally hard to start a new,   independent festival—especially when Fyre  Fest so visibility demonstrated the risks.   But of course the other risk to the festival’s  longevity is that the neighbors just get sick of   it. And it’s happened before. In 1992,  Anne Goodes, a Worthy Farm neighbor,   erected a 30-foot white cross overlooking  the festival site from her property. As a   devout Christian, Goodes was antagonistic towards  what she considered blasphemy taking place during   Glastonbury, between the free love and free drugs.  And it wasn’t just her—as the festival grew, so   too did the schism between it and the locals—so in  response, founder Michael Eavis developed a series   of solutions that today fall under the tightly  named Event Management Plan—one that’s recorded,   approved, and filed by Somerset Council. These  plans are designed to essentially contain the   festival—succesfully implemented, it should  make it so the neighbors in Pilton barely   perceive Glastonbury, even as their village  of a thousand effectively grows to 200,000.   Of course, not everything can be contained. A  certain amount of litter, for example, is to   be expected, and therefore the festival commits  to cleaning up at key sites like the surrounding   streets and local train station for three weeks  before and after the event weekend. Light and   noise pollution are also inevitable, so a 12:30  p.m curfew is instituted on the main stages on   Friday and Saturday, along with a midnight sound  curfew on Sunday. After that point, smaller stages   and venues are allowed to keep operating under  strict maximum volume conditions. In fact, to   assure compliance, crews from the council patrol  locations near the festival with decibel meters   until dawn. And the same goes for lighting, which  is installed specifically to “minimize the risk of   nuisance” onto neighbors. Even the generators  for directional lights have decibel caps.  Of course, the one thing that just simply has  to go in and out are the people. Transporting   200,000 people to the middle of the countryside  is, of course, a headache. Naturally, public   transportation is most efficient, least intrusive  to neighbors, and it’s the method of choice for at   least a third of attendees. That includes nearly  30,000 who take the Great Western Railway, which   adds more than a dozen extra trains from London  Paddington to the Castle Cary stop per day to meet   demand. That stop, however, is not at the farm and  from Castle Cary Railway Station—a tiny two-track   stop with little infrastructure—officials help to  guide the thousands of people onto shuttle buses   which take them to the farm. Riders can only bring  what they can carry—there are no trolley carts   for luggage and large items like instruments just  aren’t allowed. Buses carry another 20,000 people,   who arrive in a cascade of times over the start  of the festival and are dropped off at a dedicated   entrance, close to the action, for coaches.  And then, of course, there is everyone who drives,   with 28,000 public cars, 5,000 campervans, and  another 12,500 vehicles for employees. Traffic   management starts nearly 30 miles or 50 kilometers  away from the farm. First, there are 35 miles or   56 kilometers of designated clearways, where  cars are not allowed to stop or pull over. Then   there are more than 350 miles or 560 kilometers of  diversionary routes, forced one-ways, and dozens   of closed exits all designed to keep traffic  moving and reduce impact on local neighborhoods.   Here, roads are closed along Lottisham Road,  A37, and A361 to keep cars concentrated on   thoroughfares instead of traversing through  farm lands and disrupting rural life.    Residents, themselves, are given vehicle passes  to make sure they can still move around between   villages unimpeded. In fact, they’re given a lot  of things. Residents of Pilton, the community most   impacted, receive complimentary tickets to the  festival and the surrounding neighborhoods get   a number of price-tiered tickets along with  a designated place to park at the festival.   Officials also set up a 24-hour hotline for noise  and light complaints. And, in the fall, organizers   throw a Pilton Party—essentially a mini music  festival—as a thank you to the villagers, workers,   and local people. These efforts to work with the  community instead of against it have worked. For   55 years, the festival has returned, continually  growing in both numbers, stature, and scope.   Music festivals are incredibly complex exercises,  and they’re incredibly risky businesses,   but there’s a reason why organizers  go through all the effort and risk.   Done right, they’re also incredibly successful  businesses. They’re massively popular among fans,   and also among artists. In fact, they’re some of  the most attractive gigs out there—for headliners,   the pay is massive; for emerging artists, the  crowds are massive. And ultimately this makes   sense. For a festival to build a 200,000  person city on some empty cow pasture,   there must be a very good reason why.  So let’s say that now that you’ve learned   about the logistics of music festivals you want  to learn about the logistics of ski resorts or   search and rescue or commercial fishing or the  Hajj or coal mining or arms manufacturing. Well   boy do I have news for you. We made a whole  series called the Logistics of X that dives   into those exact subjects. That’s one of almost  a dozen different Nebula Originals produced by   the Wendover team—we’ve also made a documentary  about what happens when you're a tiny Alaskan   town almost entirely dependent on cruise ship  tourism and then COVID stops that entire industry.   We made a documentary about the political  kerfuffles that led to most of the western   half of the US relying on the Colorado River  to deliver them more fresh water than the river   actually does—the consequences are bad, by the  way. We made a documentary about what happens when   you’re a tiny British territory in the middle of  the South Atlantic who was only ever connected to   the world by a week-long ferry but now you open  an airport in 2016 and your entire way of life   changes. And we’ve made even more than just that,  but it’s worth knowing that it’s not just us:   there are hundreds of creators on Nebula.  Everyone uploads their regular videos there   ad and sponsorship free, and plenty go on to  make other great Nebula Originals. I think   Wendover viewers would particularly enjoy 17  Pages, which is a documentary by Bobby Broccoli   about one of the biggest scientific controversies  of the 20th century. It’s really well-made and,   frankly, mindblowing. If you value high-quality,  thoughtful, independent entertainment, then Nebula   is the place to be. And in my opinion, what really  seals the deal is that it’s quite affordable—when   you use our link, Nebula.tv/Wendover—you’ll get  more than 40% off an annual plan which brings   the cost down to just $36 a year.

_zfN9wnPvU0,AI Slop Is Killing Our Channel,,Educational,"Our 12,026 Human Era Calendar just  dropped – and this year is extra special. Stay tuned until the end for the reveal  or head straight to the shop to get yours. AI Slop is saturating the internet and  things are becoming dramatic pretty quickly. In an online world where  money is made with attention,   fake users spread their slop in review sections, generate fake traffic or poison discourse. AI has supercharged this and  made slop much harder to spot. Today about half of internet traffic is bots, the majority of them are used  for destructive purposes. It's never been easier to make mediocre content –  from the black hole of meaninglessness that is LinkedIN, low effort short videos just engaging enough to  hypnotise kids and fry their attention spans, to endless soullessly rewritten books on amazon. AI music is invading streaming platforms.   Google AI is summarizing websites  instead of sending traffic to them. On Youtube, new channels publish long  form videos multiple times a week with   AI generated thumbnails, voices and scripts. True crime, video essays,  science, no space is safe. We’re in the golden era of soulless slop. And sadly, actual creative human work  is used to train these AI models. Every reddit comment, original YouTube video or   human drawing on deviant art has  been sold out to the AI companies. Or straight up stolen by them. Without attribution or payment  to the actual creators. Creative theft on a scale where it  is impossible to protect against it,   already putting loads of creatives’ work  in danger – so AI companies can get rich. While this is sad and frustrating,  what’s even worse is that generative   AI truly has the potential to  break the internet irreversibly. By making it harder and  harder to tell what is true. At First AI Looked Great! A kurzgesagt script starts with basic  research that is turned into a script and then fact checked in depth by 2-3 people. We try to confirm our info  with what we deem trustworthy, ideally first hand sources, ideally papers. Then we get 1-3 experts for input and critique. Fact checking and compiling our sources  alone takes around 100 hours per video. Of course we make mistakes or oversimplify,  and you can disagree with our conclusions – it’s unavoidable, we are only human after all. But it is fair to say that our process  is extensive and after a decade,   we know what we are doing. When AI appeared we were very excited. A mechanical brain able to super  quickly collect information! So we went to work and it looked amazing! And then we started fact checking. We didn’t expect it to be perfect –  but it was way worse than we thought. Confidently Incorrect – AI is SO Bad at This We’ll summarize and generalize our experiences   over multiple projects and months  condensed into one fake project. A video about why Brown Dwarfs are the  worst and should be ashamed of themselves. So we got all the pro accounts of  all the AI models and got to work. Using deep research tools to create  a summary and overview of all the   information about the failed stars, brown dwarfs. And wow it was great! Dozens of pages of outlines with unique  information nuggets and links to sources! Then we started to look deeper. More than 80% of the info and  factoids were pretty solid and we could reconstruct where they were from. Wikipedia, papers, legit articles. What about the rest? It was great stuff,  like the speed of brown dwarf superstorms,   the nature of their insides or  how disappointed their moms are. But we could not find where  the AI got this info from. Which is not automatically a bad sign – after all, the models contain pretty much all  the internet and books ever written. So we asked experts for input – and  they flagged the exact same facts, even asking where we found it. To fulfil its goal, to make us happy,  the AI had invented or extrapolated   information to make brown dwarfs more  interesting than they really are. Like a bad journalist making up details to  make a story hit harder or fit a narrative. Now we wanted to know more and dove in deeper,   reading the seemingly more solid  sources the AI had given us in full. One was an article from a news  site written by a human journalist – or was it? It had a very familiar structure  and surely purely coincidentally,   read like what you get if a human  slightly changes AI wording. An AI essay detection tool gave it a 72% match. So an AI article without sources, used  as a credible source for AI research. Which makes sense since in 2025 there  were already well over 1200 confirmed AI   News Websites publishing massive amounts of AI  generated misinformation and false narratives. This mix of correct, dubiously sourced  and straight up made up information also   leads AI to present really shoddy conclusions that   sound strong or novel but are often  half truths or misrepresentations. Oh well. We salvaged what we could  and went back to the drawing board. And after a few weeks it happened. By pure stupid chance, we saw a brown dwarf  video popping up, by a relatively new channel. It had hundreds of thousands of views and  was pretty good, nice footage, great editing! But we had seen the structure and rhythm before. And would you look at that, it contained all   the brown dwarf facts we had flagged as  unreliable or straight up made up by AI. This is where the death of the internet begins. Now there is a proper source of  brown dwarf misinformation online. When the next AI repeats the same research,   it will find a transcript from  a video with a lot of views. The misinformation is now true. It will spread. Even before AI it was pretty hard to  find the origin of facts that sound   great but are not true – just watch  our video about a 100 year old lie. As AI use goes on it may become  impossible to know what is true or not. The Most Corrosive Lie The problem with AI is how trustworthy it  seems. How it is correct enough to seem   super smart and how incredibly  confidently incorrect it is. Casually lying to your face, often very subtly. When you catch it lying, it immediately  admits it, vows to never do it again. And then it does it again. As eloquent as current language  models feel, there is nobody home. No greater intelligence or  consciousness is talking back to you. Current AI is a very complex hammer that does not  understand what it is doing or what nails are. But we are letting it add new shelves  to the library of human knowledge. AI is changing quickly, so this may get  better, but right now it's pretty grim. Way too many people blindly trust AI. Studies looked into the language  of millions of scientific papers   published before and after the rise of LLMs. They found an abrupt and sharp increase in  the frequency of words that AIs like to use. So it seems clear that now a significant portion  of papers have been at least assisted by AI,   usually without acknowledgement. And just in July 2025 it was  discovered that a number of   researchers had started to sneak  hidden messages into their papers. In white text or too small for  the human eye they prompted AIs   to review them positively and not point out flaws. As more and more people are using AI carelessly,   the library of human knowledge is  getting less and less reliable. Which brings us the last  part: How are we using AI? And will kurzgesagt survive the AI slop age? Will AI Slop Kill Kurzgesagt And Artists? On the internet there is only one truly  valuable resource: human attention. If current trends continue it is not  that far fetched that cheap slop content,   stuff just good enough, will soak  up the majority of human attention. It could make us dumber, less informed,  our attention spans even worse,   increase political divides and make  us neglect real human interaction. If AI eats the majority of the attention pie,  channels like ours will become unfeasible. Or forced to downsize or use AI themselves to be  able to compete. We don’t want to play this game. How will we use AI? Like the align tool in adobe illustrator. If you have a bunch of boxes and  you want them to line them up,   you can do this manually, one by one. Or you can just select them, click “align”  and have them perfectly aligned in an instant. It’s the same with AI programing tools for   animation or using it as a  faster google alternative. AI is a helpful tool, but the  creativity and integrity is still ours. So dear internet, here is  what we are offering to you:   kurzgesagt is made by humans, for  humans and it will remain that way. We will produce well researched content and invest   a lot of time and our human creativity  into our illustrations and animations. Put in our creative soul into our work. We will continue to fact check  and discuss our research with   human experts, to give you the most  trustworthy information that we can. When we make mistakes, they will be our mistakes. We would rather quit than make AI slop. But to go on we need your support. kurzgesagt is almost 70 full time  people and a lot of freelancers on top. This is a lot of salaries, software  licences, laptops, rent and coffee. There is a way you can help us  keep this human-made project alive! It’s the 12,026 Human Era Calendar  – designed to fill your home with   a year's worth of kurzgesagt art  – but it’s much more than that. It’s an ode to humanity and human ingenuity. This calendar reframes time  itself by starting not 2,000,   but 12,000 years ago – at the  dawn of human civilization. This way 10,000 more years of  our shared past and incredible   achievements of our ancestors  become part of our timeline. You can use it just like a regular  calendar – but it could change how   you see your place in history, and  how far we’ve all come as a species. This time we’ve collected 12 inspiring  stories about our special connection to   the stars – from the first creature  to ever glance up at the night sky,   to ancient models of our cosmos, way  into humanity's future among the stars. Each vibrant illustration is printed  on high-quality paper with plenty of   space to plan your days or record  your adventures in the year 12,026. And because this is our 10-year calendar  anniversary, we’ve gone all out. We created the first-ever kurzgesagt artbook:   a vibrant, jam-packed collection of every  calendar illustration we’ve ever made. That’s 120 pages, and 10 years of  kurzgesagt art in one giant book. It’s also packed with behind-the-scenes sketches,  stories, and fun facts from the kurzgesagt team. Just like our videos, our products aren’t  churned out by a soulless algorithm. They’re made with love by real humans,  who spend countless hours researching,   illustrating and designing  things that we hope you’ll love. So if you value real, human-made content over  AI Slop: Join us and our global community of   Birbs who get the calendar every year  and help us keep kurzgesagt afloat. Together we’ll ride out the slop wave. The calendar and artbook are available  now, only while supplies last.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VMm-U2pHrXE,We Found a Loophole to Survive the End of the Universe,,Educational,"Can we survive the heat death of the universe?  One day, the last star will die, galaxies   will dissolve and black holes will evaporate. The cosmos will become a forever expanding,   empty void where nothing happens. Forever. A place without life, purpose, or meaning. Lame and depressing. But there might be a loophole in the laws of physics   for a future civilization to survive the death of everything. And go on having fun and internet arguments   for googols of years, maybe even forever. To explain how this works we   need to go through a few steps, so strap in if you want   consciousness to live forever. How to Outlast the Stars Let’s travel 100 trillion years into the   future, when the last stars are about to die and the cosmos starts turning dark forever.  Here, in this dying universe we find the   Noxans, the last civilization still alive. Compared to them we are cave dwellers, they have   solved physics and can do things we can only dream of. Still, the same rules of reality apply to them as to us. The Noxans like being alive and   don’t want to vanish with the last stars. So they are enacting the plan to   keep consciousness around forever. The first issue is energy. If you want  to keep a civilization running you need a   lot of it – but actually not that much in cosmic terms. With five hours of the full energy emitted by the Sun, we   could power present day humanity for about 10 billion years.  So the Noxans harvest the last stars and build a gigantic complex of batteries around their home star.  In principle, this energy could keep   them alive for a few hundred trillion years, a long time but not even close to forever.  So now the hard part of the plan begins. The Noxans need to change the nature of life itself. Thoughts Cold as Ice Being alive means doing things – eating,   playing video games and very importantly: thinking. And each of those things costs energy. But how much energy? There is an idea from a famous paper we’ll   mercilessly simplify and call Dyson's Cold Thoughts – In a nutshell the idea is that the lower your temperature,   the less energy it takes to do something. Your brain runs at a temperature   of 310 degrees above absolute zero. Zero is the temperature where   nothing can happen anymore. At 310 degrees your brain needs 20   joules of energy to think a simple thought that takes one second to think,   like “I should wear a funny hat”. If your brain worked at colder temperatures, say   155 kelvin instead of 310, a few things would change. First of all, you’d think at half the speed and   the same thought would now take two seconds. But in return, the energy you’d need to think   the thought, now halves from 20 joules to only 10. If Dyson's Cold Thoughts are correct, then the colder   you go, the less energy you need to think a thought. At one tenth your current temperature, the same   thought would take 10 seconds but only require 2 joules. And this has wild implications. Because it means that we actually   might be able to play this game forever. How could this work in reality? Cooling down a living organism isn’t easy. If we put you in a fridge, you’ll die from hypothermia. The reality is that this plan will be   impossible to do with flesh and blood, so the Noxans have to take a huge step. Before we cool anything down, consider this: Maybe the real trick is stepping back and   seeing ideas from different perspectives. Because even with more efficient brains, we’re   still prone to the same biases we face today. Nothing highlights this issue more   than our modern media landscape. Thankfully, Ground News, the sponsor of   this video, is working to confront these issues. They’re a website and app designed to help you   think critically about the information you consume  – a mission we wholeheartedly support. For each news story, they gather articles from   around the world, with details on political bias, reliability, ownership, and summaries   that show what each side leaves out. You even get to compare headlines   to see how bias affects framing. Luckily, it seems both sides agree   that robots still have a long way to go. Thinking critically about the news we consume has become   a necessity since information bubbles have become the norm. And Ground News makes it easier to do just that.

Using this link supports our channel and helps   make the media landscape a more transparent place. And now back to cooling brains! They have to leave biology behind and transfer   their minds into some kind of artificial brain. Or even better, become completely virtual minds and   build a digital world as good or better than the real one. This is getting pretty sci-fi, so to be fair we   don’t know how to build such brains or computers. But remember, we are 100 trillion years in the future, the Noxans are desperate and the   laws of physics should allow this. So now we have a pretty big battery   with a huge, but finite, amount of energy. And a lot of brains or a computer that can cool down. Ok this is great and all, but how do you   stay around with limited energy, forever? Well, this is at the core of the plan: Each time the   Noxans get colder, they need less energy to stay alive – sure they will be slower, but this isn't relevant to them. So from the Noxan's perspective, as long   as they can keep getting colder fast enough, their battery's energy is growing proportionally   and could keep them alive forever.  Let's see how their plan unfolds. Cooling Down As the last star in the universe goes  out and the universe turns dark forever, the Noxans activate their batteries   and start cooling down their brains. The way they do it is extremely simple.   How do you cool down a light bulb? Well, you unplug it so it   can radiate away its heat. So the Noxans switch off their   brains and start to hibernate. They enter a state with no   activity, thoughts or even dreams, and let their “bodies” radiate   heat away to cool down a bit.  When they activate again after some   time, they are now colder than before. They think slower and each thought   uses up less energy from their battery. They enter into a new cycle of   cosmic days and cosmic nights. During the days they are alive and awake,   doing all the stuff they want to do, hanging out with friends, thinking about things,   eating virtual cheeseburgers, simulating universes  – whatever type 3  civilizations think fun is in the future. And during the night they are switched   off, lost in dreamless non-existence. Not even noticing anything isn’t happening   while cooling down their brains even more. At the beginning the nights will be   very short and the days extremely long. A day can last a million years   while night is only a few hours. But warm things shed heat   much faster than cold ones  – cooling from 300 to 299 degrees takes   much less time than going from 100 to 99. So as the Noxan brains become colder,   the nights will have to grow longer and longer. So, how long could they actually do this   and how is this a way to live forever? How Long Could the Noxans Actually Do this? The reason Dyson's Cold Thoughts are so   incredibly powerful is how incredibly they scale. As eons pass in the dying universe, the   Noxans keep cooling down and waking up. After a 100 trillion years of this cycle, their temperature   has only dropped to 230 degrees above absolute zero. A simple thought now takes 1.3 seconds instead of 1. Each cosmic night is now 400,000 years long. But even accounting for their slower speeds and   long hibernations, the Noxans have experienced the equivalent of 76 trillion years of life. Over 5000 times the age of the current universe. This is frankly just an unsettling idea. What is way scarier than being dead? Being alive forever.  So we need to detach ourselves a little bit –   we simply have no concept how conscious beings   would deal with the opportunity   to actually live that long. Maybe our Noxans delete their memories regularly,   maybe they create new worlds and new life,  maybe at some point   they decide to sleep forever. Maybe they just activate their pleasure  centers and experience perfect bliss forever. As time keeps passing and the Noxans keep going  through their cycle of day and night and cooling down, the universe keeps dying. After quadrillions of years, the corpses of former stars,   white dwarfs, turn yellow, then orange, then red, then black.  Trillions of trillions of years later: All galaxies have dissolved like dandelions. Decillions of decillions of years later: The first black   holes evaporate in bursts of light like sad fireworks. And the Noxans? They are still around.  At a chilling 10 quintillionths degrees above zero. They’ve become so slow that a   simple thought takes a trillion years. They spend 99.999999999999999997%   of the time hibernating. But for them, nothing has changed. Their conscious experience is just   as fluid and vibrant as on the first day. From the outside they live in slow motion. As they got colder and colder   their thoughts got slower and slower. But if you and the world around you slow   down at the same pace, you don’t notice anything. Your conversations, thoughts, adventures   and experiences feel exactly the same as before. And while the cosmic nights are   now a quattuordecillion years long, it doesn’t matter to them, because during the   nights the Noxans don’t experience anything. So no matter how long the   nights are, they pass in an instant. The Noxans experience a   perfectly fluid existence. Only that with each night they   use up even less energy than before. At this point, they have lived, felt and experienced   the equivalent of 4,000 trillion trillion years.  Their battery has only a tiny   fraction of its original charge, but the Noxans now need so little energy   that it seems larger than ever before. True eternity has just begun. Or has it? Can The Noxans Actually Live Forever?  Whether Dyson's Cold Thoughts can   make you live forever depends on one thing: can you keep cooling forever, or does   the universe force you to hit a true limit? There are a few problems – dark energy might   eventually make the universe hit a temperature limit of one nonillionth degrees above absolute zero. The Noxans will cool to that   level after a googol years, but then they can’t cool any further   and their battery will begin to run out. And after this much time, the universe will   make going on impossible in other weird ways. Quantum noise might just destroy their brains. All matter may decay into iron   or proton decay may destroy all atoms. We don’t know. Forever is a long time. But even if the Noxans don’t get a true forever – if Dyson's   Cold Thoughts work, then within these googol years, their consciousness would experience  the equivalent of two trillion, trillion, trillion years. This may all seem far-fetched and hard to imagine. But the amazing thing about it is that, for all we   know, the laws of physics don’t forbid life to adapt  even to a completely dead universe.  And it would mean that life and consciousness   aren’t a brief accident in cosmic history, but the final chapter of existence itself –   giving the universe meaning, purpose and hope. Maybe forever. Here is your special connection to kurzgesagt! If you’re craving more between videos,   our newsletter delivers the latest updates   straight from the Birbs Nest to your inbox.

Let us zoom in and observe this brutal  struggle for survival – that in the   best case ends in one of the most magical things: A new life. Our story begins with an army of tens of millions  of sperm cells that immediately face death. They are on a tight timer before  they run out of energy and die. But this is the least of their problems right now. Like all bodily openings, the female reproductive  tract is a fortress defending against invaders. The future mom’s body has set up deadly  barriers and puts the sperm through a   brutal process that kills almost all of them and  ideally selects the strongest and fittest one. The first deadly obstacle is  a highly acidic environment   guarded by hundreds of thousands of guard cells. The acidity kills millions, especially of  the weaker sperm within the first half hour,   although they have a bit of protection: Seminal fluid is alkaline and so it makes  this first obstacle a little less deadly. The survivors reach the next  obstacle, a treacherous maze   full of protein nets where millions more  find a brutal end getting stuck and lost. Now if a woman is in the part of her menstrual  cycle where she is ovulating , her body helps   the sperm out a bit, by releasing chemicals that  guide the way and by being a bit less hostile. Luckily for our brave sperm  this is the case today. Only a couple hundred – less than 0.0001% of  the original sperm – pass through into the   uterine cavity, where two tunnels branch out. Here mucus helps transport the stronger sperm  to move on, while weeding out the weaker ones. The mom’s immune cells pick off and devour every  cell that trails behind or takes the wrong turn. And then finally, maybe just a few dozen  sperm reach their goal, the mighty, giant egg. 10,000 times bigger than them, it is an industrial  scale monster loaded with nutrients and nearly   100,000 mitochondria, the powerhouse of the  cell – 50 times more than an average cell. But the egg is not easily conquered  – the survivors get closer and try   to get in until the egg decides  to accept a single one of them. The genes of two individuals merge. The egg stops being part of its  mother – it is something else now. A new being with its own agenda. Not a human yet, but the potential to become one. Like a thought that is not yet a word. But its mom’s body hasn’t decided  yet if she wants to say it out loud. It will have to fight for that. For a few days it rapidly divides and grows to a  couple of hundred cells, while traveling down to   the uterus, the part of the female reproductive  system where it will try to make its new home. Here it begins to divide into two specialised   teams of cells - one will  eventually become the baby. The other cells are trophoblasts and their job is  to turn into a temporary organ inside the mother: the placenta, that will make  pregnancy possible and eventually die. This means that when you were an embryo  there was this whole other part of you,   not like a twin, even closer,  maybe like a guardian angel clone. These cells never had the  chance to become a human,   their only purpose in life was to make you exist. In any case, the following days are the  most dangerous for the potential new life. Like a tennis ball rolling through syrup   the young embryo moves along the  uterus and tries to take a hold. An intense chemical dialog between  two living things begins, the embryo   releases dozens of chemicals that announce  its presence and asks the guard cells of the   uterine wall to allow it to please, please,  please attach itself so it can survive. The uterus responds with dozens of  hormones and immune signals itself. If it is satisfied with the quality of the  chemical conversation its cells allow it. If it doesn’t the embryo will be lost and die. This is where we begin to see  that the interests of both   living beings no longer completely align anymore. Pregnancy is a huge energy  investment so the mother’s   body will eject the embryo if  it doesn’t see it as viable. The embryo on the other hand faces a life and   death situation and tries  to stay alive at any price. So it’s not asking politely but deploying  thousands of infiltration units: Bubbles filled with genetic  material, kind of like a human virus! They sort of invade the uterine  cells and try to brainwash them,   so they help it attach itself,  rather than rejecting it. During this time one of the weirdest  features of pregnancy occurs: the uterus provides uterine milk, not real milk  but a clear fluid filled with nutrients and   hormones that the young embryo sucks up hungrily  to gain additional energy until it gets inside. If the embryo is allowed in, the implantation  was successful, the first critical hurdle. The next step is to reach the  blood vessels of its mother,   the only way to survive if  it doesn't want to starve. The trophoblasts begin to clone themselves on a  massive scale and turn into different specialists. One of them turns into a violent invader  that starts drilling into the uterine   tissue like a tiny parasitic octopus  with many arms, spreading and growing. This is a brutal process, ordering loads of  it’s mom’s uterus cells to destroy themselves,   killing others directly or even  devouring some cells whole. While this sounds brutal, and it is, this process  is highly regulated and doesn’t hurt the mom. It is another test. The mom’s body monitors carefully how the   embryo is doing – is it growing  quickly or if it is more chill. If an embryo has genetic damage  or chromosomal abnormalities it   will spend way more energy on repairing  itself and maybe grow more erratically. This makes it metabolically noisy, releasing  loads of chemicals the mom’s immune cells pick up. Which provokes them and makes it more  likely that they will destroy it. On the other hand, if the embryo is  weak it is metabolically too quiet   and the mom will stop talking to  it – which also ends the pregnancy. This embryo is just right, so the mom’s  cells release a flood of different chemicals to help it out, support it growing and most  importantly, activate her immune system. Usually this would be very bad –  the immune system kills everything   that is not part of the mom’s body, and  this embryo is clearly not part of her. But the immune cells of the uterus  surround the embryo and start helping it,   guiding the trophoblast to grow further. They create a physical and chemical safe zone that   tells dangerous immune cells  like T Cells to stay away. The embryo has its own motives and doesn't  want to rely on its mothers goodwill alone – so defensive trophoblasts send out signals that   kill her immune cells if they get too  close and could start attacking it. Hundreds of cells go even further  and leave the embryo behind. They spread all across the mom’s  body, entering organs, even the brain. We don’t know what all of these cells  are doing but we think that they are   probably telling her immune system  that the embryo is not to be attacked. That it should be left alone or even protected. These cells may stay inside the  mother for years or even decades. It is likely that parts of  you are still in your mother. Around 8 weeks after the egg was fertilized,  the transition from the embryo to fetus begins – the size of an olive, its organs begin to form   and it turns from a blob into  something vaguely human-like. Is there a clear point where a  clump of cells becomes a human? Not really. It is a fluid transition and every society and   person – be it morally or legally  – marks this moment differently. Meanwhile construction trophoblasts  are busy building a spongy fingerlike   structure that expands further into  the uterus, a completely new organ: The placenta – an organ that you once grew inside  your mother, that was ejected after your birth and died a silent death while everybody  was busy welcoming you into the world. In our story the placenta is now the new  home of the fetus. An enormous fortress,   protecting it from microbes that could infect  and kill it in its still pretty fragile state. It even has its own mini immune system,   placental immune cells that gobble  up anything that poses a threat. Other placental cells creep along the  inside of the mom's blood vessels, stretching them and connecting the fetus  through the umbilical cord on the other side. With the blood flow secured, it’s time  to load it with as much food as possible. The placenta releases hormones that  funnel glucose directly to the fetus, stealing energy from its mom. If the fetus goes too far and asks  too much, this can sometimes lead to gestational diabetes for the mom during  the pregnancy, starving her body of energy. The mothers body is trying to support the new  life, but not at the cost of her own survival. In a sense the mothers genes inside the  fetus still have a stronger allegiance   to her than to the new being –  but it’s fathers genes don’t. They want the fetus to survive at all costs. So while there is a sort of fragile  peace between both parties, it is just that – their interests are not perfectly  aligned and both sides have to deal with that. In the next few months the fetus will  increase its weight over a billion times,   which demands a staggering  amount of energy and cooperation. They still need to work together  to get out of this alive. But if the fetus gets to this point in  the pregnancy, chances are pretty high   that it will become a baby like you once  were, a proper human, like you are today. A being with immense potential. If you are alive today then you went through  an amazingly brutal selection process. From a little pack of genes traveling  through an incredibly deadly obstacle course,   fighting for your survival, with desperate  words spoken through chemicals and sneaky   actions trying to outsmart the system,  fighting to be alive in this world. But this is only one side of the story –  you were also chosen – by hormones that   led you to the right place, by the  egg allowing you to merge into one. By your mom’s body that  liked how you spoke to her,   by her cells that protected and cared for you. Nourished by an incredible amount of  energy that your mother gifted you.

dKm7T13X7n4,Can Humanity Stop A Planet-Killing Asteroid?,,Educational,"Our first ever PC game, Star Birds,   is out now in Early Access!  Find out more at the end of this video! Imagine: a stadium sized asteroid is   going to hit Earth in two weeks. Even at this moderate size, a fireball brighter   than the Sun tears through the atmosphere at 60 times the speed of sound and the destructive   power of 4,000 Hiroshima bombs flattens cities, killing millions. This isn’t science fiction. Many killer asteroids were only   spotted at the last moment. In 2019, asteroid OK, as big as a 30-story   building, was discovered just one day before it grazed earth closer   than some of our satellites.  Last year, the even larger asteroid MK was spotted   13 days before it passed us closer than the Moon. If they had hit Earth, they would have unleashed the   destructive power of 3,000 and 9,000 Hiroshima bombs. Stunningly enough, humanity   doesn’t really have a plan for this. Scientists have devised all kinds of   tricks to push dangerous asteroids away  – painting it so sunlight will deflect it,   landing thrusters to steer it,  scorching it with lasers, or even crashing spacecraft into it. But they all have a big problem: They are the equivalent of trying to deflect a   cargo ship by throwing a bag of potatoes at it – they do move the asteroid, but only by a tiny bit. With these methods, you need to act years or even   decades in advance to make an asteroid miss the Earth. But very recently scientists have developed   a new spectacular way to destroy killer asteroids that we could implement   with today’s technology. Let’s see how this works with our   100 m asteroid heading for Earth! The Secret Weakness of Asteroids For a long time, people imagined   asteroids as being gigantic stones. Made of rock and metal. But it turns out, most of them aren’t like that.  They are more like bags of loosely packed gravel – heaps of pebbles, precious minerals   and dust, barely held together.  Which means that instead of just nudging them,   we can do something better – pulverize them. And the obvious choice is, of course, a nuke! So, let’s go! We load up a nuclear warhead,   launch, aim at our deadly asteroid and… Oh. The asteroid destroyed the nuke! Asteroids can approach Earth at 70,000 km/h   – enough to cross the Atlantic in 5 minutes. No bomb we’ve ever made   could survive such an impact. So if we go for a head-on collision, the asteroid will   wreck the nuke before it even has a chance to explode. Ok easy, let’s explode the bomb   before it touches the asteroid. Scientists have estimated the optimal   distance, which for our 100 m killer friend would be a few tens of   meters above the surface. Launch, set the timer and… Sad Boom! The explosion has made a   dramatic crater and... nothing else. Unfortunately in space there is no air to carry a   shockwave, so most of the explosion’s energy is lost. The rock will still hit us in two weeks, only a few kilometers to the left. Striking such a behemoth with a nuke is like hitting our cargo ship with a   washing machine instead of potatoes – better, but still useless. Ok, let’s go the movie route – land someone on the asteroid, drill a hole and   bury a nuke inside to avoid all of these problems!  And indeed this is possible in   theory, albeit suicidal in practice.   Landing on any space body is a nightmare. Even on fairly big Mars, whose surface we know   almost perfectly, roughly 70% of our attempts have failed. So imagine the chances of landing a crew and a   nuclear bomb on a small and extremely fast asteroid  discovered just two weeks in advance. Even if we succeeded, drilling in microgravity is   painfully slow, since there is no downward pull to help you.  So we’d need an agonizing   amount of time that we don’t have. So sadly, that's not the answer. We have to think less like Hollywood   and more like a lumberjack. The Smart Way If you want to split a log,   you don’t hit it with a rock. You use an axe – a dense and perfectly   shaped tool designed to break things apart. And just in the same way, scientists have   found a new tool to destroy asteroids: super-dense, ultra-fast, cosmic bullets. We won’t even have to shoot them! Our cosmic bullets are called “penetrators”. A few meters long, slim and made of tungsten,   a metal way denser and harder than rock. They work in an extremely simple way: You just put the penetrators in the way of   the asteroid, to float silently in space. From the perspective of the asteroid, you   wouldn’t see a few tiny bullets sitting still.   You’d see them rushing at you at 70,000 km/h! It doesn’t matter who stands still and who is fast! But this speed means that by far the longest part   of this mission is to get to the asteroid in time. We can’t destroy it too close to Earth because its   fragments will slam into the atmosphere all at once with the power of thousands of nuclear bombs. Our atmosphere can absorb isolated chunks  – but if thousands of them strike together,   their shockwaves will add up and kill millions. So instead we need to get it one day before impact,   when the asteroid will be nearly 2 million kilometers away, more than 4 times further than the Moon.  A vast distance, but doable. Our current rockets can   cover this in about a week. We’ll send just one penetrator, about 2   meters long and weighing 2.5 tonnes. Once our rocket arrives, it puts the   penetrator in place to cause maximum damage … and then we wait. A tiny speck of light appears in the   vast distance, and then suddenly it's here, shooting at us faster than the speed of sound. We’ll slow down time to see exactly what happens. The asteroid crashes into the penetrator   so fast and with so much violence  that the power of 120 metric tons   of TNT is released into the asteroid.   The rock vaporizes and the tungsten melts away,   carving a wound that tunnels through the asteroid. The damage is too much, and with all   of this energy looking for a place to go, the asteroid is blasted   into thousands of pieces. The debris spreads out into a diffuse cloud. A day later the fragments hit Earth, dispersed   over hundreds of thousands of square kilometers and turning an apocalypse into a   mostly harmless show of cosmic fireworks. So if we prepare and get everything ready,   spotting a killer asteroid with   two-weeks notice would be enough. But this was just a small asteroid. What if we face a cosmic mountain, a planet killer,   carrying the destructive power of   tens of thousands of nuclear arsenals. The non avian dinosaurs would   tell you about it but they’re dead. What If It Is a Planet Killer? Planet killers are objects so vast and powerful that   they would end most life on earth in a single strike. The most dangerous ones are comets   from the outer fringes of the solar system, so distant and dark that   tracking them is impossible. Comets are dirty ice balls the size of   mountains, more fragile than pure rock but also much faster and violent,   traveling at around 140,000 km per hour. In 2020 the comet NEOWISE, with the power of   6,000 times all the nuclear bombs on Earth, was discovered just 4 months   before its closest approach to Earth. What if we find such a beast six months   before it’s going to crash into Earth? Do we have a chance of surviving this? Unfortunately this would be   extremely hard for a bunch of reasons. First of all our planet killer comet has so  much more mass than a tiny killer asteroid, that simply breaking it into millions   of pieces would not help us that much. The chunks that hit Earth would   still be massive and numerous enough to set the sky ablaze   and kill most life on Earth. So we need to make most if not all of   its fragments completely miss Earth – but to do that we need to destroy it   much further away – as far away as Mars. And to destroy a mountain, we need way   more penetrators – hundreds of thousands. And this is... well, a huge problem. To travel this far and to transport this much payload,  we need at least 24,000 super heavy rockets. As of today, humanity has… two  – and they’re not really finished yet. Even if all the industries in the world do   nothing but switch to building rockets, we would not finish in time. If we actually discovered a planet killer today,   there is literally nothing we could do about it. Except…  Maybe if we combine penetrators with a bit of Hollywood   and our old friend, the nuclear bomb, there is still a way. For this plan to work we basically need   to have all the parts ready beforehand.  A rocket like NASA’s SLS – the one   planned to take astronauts to the Moon  – loaded up with everything   we need, ready to launch. As soon as the planet killer is spotted on its way   to wipe us out we launch a single rocket to meet it.  For 5 long months it travels through the nothingness   of space as life on Earth nervously continues. Finally it reaches its destination   a bit beyond the orbit of Mars. Now we deploy 5 massive penetrators in sequence,   one perfectly lined up two kilometers after the other. The engineering challenge of aligning and timing this   correctly is horrendous and we only have one attempt.  So a few very brave astronauts go on this one way   trip to supervise the process, with no way home. Nervous hours pass as all of humanity   watches the skies and screens. And then the moment comes. The icy mountain of death appears   in full and then it’s already here!  Slow down time again! The comet smashes into the   first penetrator at 140,000 km/h, unleashing the power of 2,000 tons of TNT. Ice, rock and tungsten liquify in an instant as the energy of the impact eats itself   dozens of meters deep into the mountain.  Here is the second one, perfectly hitting the same spot   punching directly into the crater, smashing, melting, drilling. The third and fourth penetrators repeat the process   again, now smashing a tunnel about 100 meters deep. But this time this is just a scratch on the surface of   the monster, the comet is not really damaged yet. And then comes the final   penetrator and its toxic load. 300 megatons in nuclear warheads – 20,000 times   more energy than the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima. It travels deep into the tunnel and   just before it hits the end, it explodes. This time the nuke works.  Instead of hitting nothing in the vacuum the energy   of the explosion smashes into rock and gravel and ice.  On top of vaporizing it from the inside, there is so much shock and push and punch that   a frozen world billions of years old dies from within. Turning into a cloud of millions   of fragments spreading in all directions. Humanity is saved. To make this happen in reality would take   unprecedented planning and precision. And yet, it’s possible. Not in a century with sci-fi technology. Just with the rockets, engineering, and   knowledge we already have today. Want to drill some Asteroids yourself?

gtDKKJq9u30,The Dumbest Animal Alive,,Educational,"The Sunfish, or Mola, is   the dumbest creature alive. Not just from an intelligence   perspective  – I mean, look at it! It's a being of extremes and   comically bad at being an animal. Its evolutionary strategy is to be   chunky boys, weaker than their predators, staring into the ocean with empty dumb   eyes, eating the least nutritious food possible but growing amazingly fast, getting   infested by parasites and dying horribly. If you presented the sunfish in animal invention   class everybody would be really upset with you. And yet somehow the Mola   doesn't just survives but thrives. How? Like actually how? Are you ok Evolution? The genus of Mola is a fish built wrong, a giant   head that evolution lost interest in half way through. Its body is very flat and circular without a real   tail, instead it has a sort of rudder-like stump. Two fins on the top and bottom give it   an ... uhm ... unorthodox swimming style. They propel themselves forward by flapping their fins   in a goofy wobbling motion with as little grace as possible. It’s less like swimming and   more like underwater flying – although when they really try, Mola can   match strong swimmers like salmon or marlins. Sunfish also don’t have a swim bladder, the   gas-filled organ most fish use for buoyancy. Instead they have a jelly-like layer of   flesh that is 90% water to dive or surface, which definitely doesn’t help with agility. Most of the time Mola cruises around leisurely. Their teeth are fused into a parrot-like beak that   sits in a tiny gaping pout that's open most of the time. Together with two huge empty eyes, the sunfish   has a perpetual derpy face, always looking stunned. Sunfish don’t have proper scales but some of   the thickest skin in the ocean after whales. Up to 15 cm thick, it's rough and rubbery and often   covered in mucus​, like armour made from car tyres. Although most of what it is protecting   is not that great in the first place. Sunfish can become as big   and massive as a large car but its organs are collected together in the front of   their body, while most of their bulk is oddly textured, flabby, gelatinous tissue – an animal   made from all the worst parts of a steak. This very mid meat is supported by a sort of weird   skeleton without ribs or a tailbone and a lot of cartilage. Their weird bodies are a mobile mini ecosystem,   infested and saturated with around 50 species of parasites – probably more than any other fish. Crustaceans, barnacles, various worms and   protozoans live on and in their skin, muscles, gills or organs. They are such a paradise for parasites that even   their parasites have their own smaller parasites! Some Mola are also followed by an entourage of other fish   that seek protection, food scraps or feed on their inhabitants. This awkward situation may be the   root of their most bizarre behavior: Mola frequently swim to the surface   to float on their side like a pancake. They are sunbathing to warm   up again from deep cold dives – which is where   they got their name from. But they also do it to present their   body to seabirds like albatrosses. The birds start picking the parasites from the Sunfish   body – while smaller fish that live near the surface take care of the bottom half   – cleaning them in exchange for a snack. While this is a great adaptation   to their parasite infection it sadly often leads to dead   sunfish when they collide with boats. Since they are still cold and slow from   the deep when they float on the surface, they can't react to anything coming at them. Once Mola reach a certain size   most predatory fish seem to avoid them, probably wrongfully assuming their   size means that they could fight back – and because their outsides are too tough. But orcas, sharks and sea lions sometimes   attack and take a bite – usually only to say: “No thank you, I prefer starving to death”. Because for big predators sunfish are watery, not very   nutritious, cartilage filled, parasite-ridden jelly donuts. They simply prefer to eat almost anything else. Leaving Molas swimming around with big   chunks missing, looking even more ridiculous. Sea lions have been observed to skip   the whole sunfish and only eat its organs, play with its body like a frisbee and   then leave the rest for scavengers. The sunfish might be sad about all of this but we will never know because our   chunky boys are incredibly stupid. Loveable Chunky Derpy Idiots Sunfish have one of the lowest brain   to body ratios in the animal kingdom. A car-sized mola has a walnut-sized   brain and only a tiny spine. So its mind runs an early alpha version   of intelligence with updates disabled. If you look a sunfish deep in the eyes,   you will mostly see your reflection. Despite or maybe because of their   daftness they are pretty gentle fish that show no aggression towards other   larger animals and are friendly to humans. Sometimes they even approach divers or boats to   check out what they are and to stare at them derpily. Even if sunfish could get angry, they kind of   lack the tools or temperament to hurt a human. Adult sunfish are loners that spend most of their   lives drifting and wobbling through the ocean solo, although sometimes they   come together to make babies. Spotting two sunfish making   love is extremely difficult because they rendezvous in the deep ocean​. But we know that their strategy is   for 99.999% of their offspring to die.  Female mola carry far more eggs   than any other vertebrate on Earth – hundreds of millions of   eggs in a single mating party! Sunfish eggs are tiny and float in the plankton,   where millions are eaten, starve or don't even hatch. The larvae that do hatch are   adorable rice grain sized weirdos covered in little star shaped spines with   the derpy facial expression of adult sunfish. All kinds of predators gobble up   these tiny mola by the millions, so to have any chance they   need to become large quickly. Luckily sunfish have the most   rapid and extreme growth of any animal – a larva can increase its weight   60 million times from hatching to adult​. This is the equivalent of a human baby   growing to the weight of an aircraft carrier. If you grow fast you need   a lot of nutritious food, and this is why Mola have chosen to   specialize on the dumbest meal available. The Dumbest Predator vs The Dumbest Prey  The sunfish found a truly   remarkable ecological niche: If your prey is so pathetic that some other predators   don’t want to bother with it, you have it all for yourself. Mola are generalized predators   with a focus on small and soft stuff. Their huge eyes can see incredibly   well, especially in dim water, and they can sneak up on small prey   or sift through drifting zooplankton. Mostly fish larvae, squids, shrimps, mollusks, starfish,   small crustaceans – really any soft critter they can get to. But maybe their favorite meals are   from the jelly kind of sea life, like jellyfish, ctenophores and salps – which really is something since these are almost   entirely water and have almost no calories. So to get any meaningful amount of nutrition   sunfish can mow through swarms of jellyfish, sometimes devouring thousands in a single day. Without a swim bladder, Mola can dive very deep and   surface quickly and freely, giving them a huge range, able to travel dozens of kilometers a   day to graze on the seafloor or reefs, hunt for jelly in the deep or consume   plankton and algae near the surface. Mola are the cows of the ocean. Huge and constantly floating around   slurping in high volumes of low nutrient food. Since they don’t really chew with their beak,   sunfish have found another absurd way to eat: Long, claw-like teeth in their throat. Mola suck in their prey, pull it through their   throat teeth that prevent it from escaping and maybe move it around and rip it   apart like a slow motion wood chipper. Ok. As much as we are roasting the sunfish   – and don’t worry, it doesn’t understand that we are making fun of it –   actually it is kind of genius. Nature has a sense of humor and   has left niches in the ecosystem that are best filled by being   passive and bad at everything. Mola are derpy goofballs   that are bullied by everyone. And while it is fun to call them dumb   actually they are a highly specialized   and resilient species, widely spread   throughout the oceans of the world. A marvel of evolution. A truly genius creature. And as the human gazes into the sunfish’s eyes and wonders how evolution could   produce such an ingenious creature… Sunny suddenly wonders about her own origins. There is a deeper version of her story that nobody told her   – so let’s help her find out. With the MyHeritage DNA test she can   take a deep dive into her own DNA, discover her family history, and   explore her geographic origins. And for only $29, she decides to go for it! The DNA test is incredibly simple: just a quick swab inside her check,   pop it back in the mail, and that's it! After a few weeks, she gets her results back. Like taking a journey back through the millennia, she can now explore her ancestors’   fingerprints etched into her DNA. With Ancient Origins, a new feature by MyHeritage   DNA, Sunny traced her story back 10,000 years — to find out she’s  descended from Norse Vikings! And there is more: she also discovers thousands   of distant relatives all over the world! All these people share a small part of her DNA …  makes you wonder if they like   Sunfish as much as she does. This was more than just a DNA test -   it was like a global family reunion! If you are curious about what   your DNA might reveal about you, order your MyHeritage DNA kit today: for just $29. Click the link, or scan the QR code.

u4LUix-BU0s,The Drug To Master Reality,,Educational,"Amphetamines can drive you through brutal work   shifts, push you through boring study sessions or keep you dancing til dawn. They   fuel ambitions and sharpen minds. We’ve given  them to soldiers to fight   harder and to children to help them focus. Today, millions of brains are running   faster than evolution had ever planned. In the last 15 years amphetamines have become one   of the fastest-growing drug markets in the world, second only to cannabis. Like any drug, amphetamines   can be used to escape reality. But unlike any other, they promise   to help us master our modern world. What makes them so appealing and what   happens to your body once you take them? Supercharging Your Brain Almost everything humans do   relies on focus and motivation. Whether you are working, playing, studying,  creating, working out, partying or fighting, you need to push through exhaustion,   silence distractions and stay in sync. Amphetamines are stimulants and   do just this extremely well. They come in three main types: plain   amphetamine, methamphetamine, and MDMA. Meth is an extremely potent and addictive version, and MDMA, or ecstasy,   has some quite unique effects but today we’ll focus on plain amphetamine – sold on the street  as speed or as  prescription drugs like Adderall or Vyvanse. The main effect of amphetamines   is to trick your brain to massively increase the levels   of dopamine and noradrenaline. Dopamine is the chemical of motivation and  excitement – like the rush when you're about to beat that impossible boss in a Souls Game. Noradrenaline makes your mind   awake, focused, alert and sharp – able to precisely and quickly move your fingers   to perform the combo that destroys the boss. Dopamine says “yes, this matters!”  and noradrenaline gives you   the tools to make it happen. On amphetamines you aren’t simply excited,   but plugged into a hidden power source. You can quickly absorb and   react to everything around you, your attention is locked in the moment, in the   best case you enter a state of flow easily. Your mood is lifted and boring   tasks seem more engaging. Distractions become less distracting   in the face of your goals. Your heart pounds faster, your breath   quickens and sweat beads on your skin, hunger fades and fatigue dissolves. Other stimulants like   cocaine peak or fade quickly, maybe crashing you and leaving   you more tired than before, but amphetamines lift you up and   hold you there for 4 to 14 hours. Back in the day amphetamines used to   be prescribed for all kinds of problems – to lose weight, fix your depression   or against nasal congestion. Nowadays they are mainly prescribed for ADHD  – a mental disorder that makes it hard to concentrate on things you find   boring and to control your impulses. ADHD brains are basically  looking for a reward that never comes – amphetamines solve this   by providing this reward. Turning a super easily distracted   scatter brain into a focused one. In the last decades ADHD diagnoses in  kids and adults in the US have skyrocketed leading to an unprecedented amount   of prescription amphetamines. But amphetamines aren’t   just drugs - they are tools. Performance enhancing tools, perfectly  aligned with our most mainstream ambitions. And if they manage to keep you awake and   focused better than coffee or energy drinks, why not get your daily performance   boost with a dose of amphetamines? They’re made in labs, prescribed by doctors,   and safely taken by millions after all! So their legal and illegal use   has surged in many workplaces, particularly in very stressful   or highly competitive industries that require long hours and intense focus. From tech to finance bros, from cooks   or truck drivers to surgeons or nurses. In the US alone more than 4 million people   illegally use prescription stimulants. Especially college students have started to   rely on them more and more – not to party, but to push for better grades. Concentrating and studying are hard   enough on their own, but even more so in times where short form videos and endless   scrolling have nuked our attention spans. Some believe they have undiagnosed ADHD, that their struggle to concentrate is   a flaw that needs chemical fixing, or they simply want an easy   edge to achieve more. Imagine you’re cramming for finals. Someone   offers you a pill and the fog in your brain lifts. 8 hours vanish in a hyper-focused blur.   Should you take another one tomorrow? This is starting to sound like a commercial. But the frank reality is that amphetamines promise an easy fix to things that many of us struggle with. But of course, nothing good   in life comes for free. Speed Crash The dark side of amphetamines  comes in two flavors: Unpleasant side effects and serious health risks. The least negative bad experience may be that   amphetamines work, just not for the right thing. Instead of finally writing the paper that is due   tomorrow you hyperfocus on grinding your game. And then the day is over. Congrats on the   new item, but you will still fail your class. More serious is that noradrenaline puts   your body into fight or flight mode, which can make you feel   nervous, tense, and on edge. Your heart beats faster and   your breaths are shorter. Which is exactly how your body feels   when you experience anxiety or panic. Suddenly you feel extremely   worried or can’t stop ruminating. If you are already pretty stressed or anxious   this can worsen your anxiety or even   lead to a full blown panic attack. On the other hand your motivation can overshoot. Your patience shrinks to almost zero and you   can feel wired and very annoyed at people because they speak and think too slowly. Making you jittery and   pretty unpleasant to others. Amphetamines also make you numb   towards the needs of your body. So it is easy to forget that you   need to drink, eat and sleep. You may suddenly realize that you are   totally dehydrated, tired and shaky, after neglecting your body's   needs for hours and hours. And while amphetamines lengthen the time   you can stay awake and be productive, if you took them too late in the day or too much, it may just be impossible to get to   sleep as your mind can’t stop racing. Making you exhausted the next day – tempting   you to solve the problem with another dose. If you take too much all the   enhancing effects can reverse, leaving you nervous, restless,   obsessively overthinking or outright unable to focus on anything. Some prescription amphetamines like Vyvanse   stay active in your system for up to 14 hours. So if you have a bad trip   you may have to wait it out. And the come down can also be pretty harsh – after hours of being bathed in dopamine   and noradrenaline their levels drop suddenly. You may feel extreme fatigue, your mood can crash,   leaving you feeling low energy and depressed. You may experience a fresh boost of anxiety   as your brain tries to rebalance itself. And of course, there is addiction. But first of all, constant artificial dopamine highs   can totally disrupt your emotional baseline. Swinging from euphoric and super focused and   driven to stressed and tired is pretty unpleasant. If you take amphetamines   regularly you build a tolerance,   needing higher doses to achieve the same effects. Which raises the risk for   all the negative effects. Maybe at the beginning amphetamines were   the solution to finally do your homework, but after a while you just feel completely   unable to study or work at all without the boost they give you. It can be hard to get back to   your normal baseline afterwards. Ok, not ideal – but can   amphetamines destroy your life? Well, maybe. Definitely your brain and heart. The flood of chemicals that boosts   your brain can overwhelm it, mixing noise and signal and turning   clarity into chaos, leading to psychosis – you can no longer tell for sure   what is real and what is not. Typical symptoms are bizarre   thoughts, hallucinations and paranoia. In most cases they fade once the drug wears off. But sometimes they stay for months,   and for a minority of people  they can evolve into full-fledged   schizophrenia, changing your life forever. Amphetamines speed up   your heart and over time even mild increases in blood   pressure can damage vessel walls, causing them to thicken,   narrow, and lose elasticity, which forces your heart to work harder. If you use them long term this can lead to   serious complications like cardiac   arrest or an irregular heartbeat. And in high enough doses, especially   mixed with other stimulants like cocaine, amphetamines can trigger heart   attacks, tear open major arteries or burst blood vessels in your brain,   leading to strokes – even in young people. How likely is this to happen? Today it seems that low-dose prescription use over   the short term for ADHD is relatively low risk while chronic and especially heavy use   in healthy people is probably harmful. If you want our opinion after our research:  Amphetamines are a huge grey zone. A part of society runs on speed because it wants   to work more, be more focused, faster and longer. For some people they are an effective   way to treat a real underlying condition, for some they are a great health risk. Without medical guidance and proper  care, amphetamines can turn you into a terribly on edge, anxious and   unpleasant version of yourself. They are an easy but also a short term fix – and probably not a sustainable long term solution if you do not have an underlying condition. You can brute force your mind and body   to do what you want them to right now – but amphetamines are not helping   you to acquire better habits or to grow and become a better version of yourself. But we are not the health police. You do you – but hopefully you do so as   informed and responsibly as possible.

aOwmt39L2IQ,Alcohol is AMAZING,,Educational,"Alcohol is the most harmful substance on Earth.  Every year it kills more people than terrorism,   wars, homicides and car accidents combined.  It injures tens of millions in accidents,   violence and crime; while keeping  hundreds of millions trapped in   disease. If it didn’t exist already,  inventing it today would be unthinkable. And yet, more than 2 billion people drink. Most  of us can't imagine a barbecue without beer,   a wedding without wine or a fancy  soirée without champagne. We have   a drink at the weekend because it's the  weekend. But also after work. When we   are stressed and when we are relaxed.  Sad and happy. At home and outside. Alcohol is kind of a paradox. Why do we cling  so much to the thing that harms us the most? You After One Drink Alcohol is a biological weapon that yeast produces  during fermentation to wipe out its competition.   In alcoholic drinks it’s mixed with water and  flavored with everything from fruits to caramel. With just one sip, sextillions of alcohol  molecules flood your stomach and small intestine.   From there they head to your liver – your primary  detox center, and to other organs like the brain.   But your liver can only process about one  sip of beer every 5 minutes. So unless you   drink really slowly, it will become overwhelmed  while an ever-growing swarm floods your brain. Here’s where the chaos begins. The  legion of intruders fills your brain   and starts messing with neurotransmitters and  receptors. Their sabotage is so complex that   scientists aren’t fully sure yet about  all their mechanisms. But we know that   alcohol numbs your neurons, making them  slower and disrupts their communication. This has several effects. It sedates you, melting  away tension and stress. It stuns your prefrontal   cortex, your center for decision-making and  self-control, making you more disinhibited   and prone to say or do things that you normally  wouldn’t. And it releases endorphins – “feel good”   molecules deeply tied to human connection.  The chemicals that we produce when we laugh,   sing or dance with others, and which help us  turn fleeting moments into shared memories. So after a drink or three, the world doesn’t only  feel lighter. It feels lighter with others. The   invisible walls of insecurity around us begin to  soften and you find yourself becoming a little   more… you. Less afraid to talk, laugh, sing or  share joys and sorrows. Conversations flow easier,   smiles last a little longer, and strangers  can become friends or lovers more easily.   So for a while, it feels like the weight  of being human isn’t yours to carry alone. Alcohol sits at a sweet spot of gentle  relaxation, mild courage and friendly   companionship that makes it the perfect social  lubricant. One that comes with quite a few costs. Your Body on Regular Drinking For billions, these rounds become more frequent  over time. The occasional drink becomes a weekly   habit, then a ritual every other day,  catching up with friends or unwinding.   And there's always this buddy who drinks  way more and has a perfectly normal life. But as the rounds add up over years, the  damage builds up. The alcohol molecule   can dissolve in water and fat, which allows  it to invade almost every cell and tissue.   And when your body breaks it down, it transforms  into acetaldehyde – a chemical that is even more   toxic than alcohol itself and that wreaks  havoc on your tissues, cells and DNA. In your brain, this shrinks your  neurons and severs their connections,   making it harder for different parts of the  brain to communicate. As your brain withers,   your memories fade, your thinking slows  down and your risk of dementia increases.   When and how you drink matters – the  younger you are, the wider the damage;   and the more you drink in one  go, the worse you’ll make it. The human brain isn’t fully  wired until your mid 20s,   so drinking before that age is like smashing  wet cement before it has set. In 20-year-olds,   blackout drinking episodes have been  found to cause mental problems for up   to a year – forgetting why you entered a room  or having difficulty learning new things. Binge   drinking in late adolescence is also one of the  highest risk factors for early-onset dementia. Then there is cancer. Just as smoking  hits your lungs, alcohol causes 8 types of   cancer – basically everywhere from mouth to bowel,  plus breast cancer in women. Here risks start at   an average consumption of less than 1 glass  of wine per day. Beyond that, risks increase.   Worldwide, alcohol causes around 740,000 new  cancer cases per year, leading to 400,000 deaths. Another victim is your liver. Alcohol disrupts fat  metabolism, causing fat to build up in your liver   cells. But this often has no symptoms, so you may  go on drinking as your liver slowly turns to fat,   swells with inflammation and starts to fail. The  final stage is cirrhosis – your liver is full of   scars and barely functioning. This might take  over 10 years, but once it appears it's largely   irreversible. Every year, 600,000 people die  because they have a liver destroyed by alcohol. Drinking also weakens your heart, raises  blood pressure and increases the risk of   stroke and thrombosis – leading to another 500,000  deaths from cardiovascular diseases every year. In terms of looks too, alcohol damages  cells around your body, including your   skin which looks older, sooner. And not only  does alcohol contain a lot of calories itself,   it also makes many people very hungry. Drinking  is a huge source of weight gain and increases   the risk of obesity, opening the door  to a cascade of other health problems. When scientists crunch these numbers,  they see that health problems can start   at about 1 beer a day, and that the  chances of premature death start   rising significantly at around 3 beers a  day for men, and less than 2 for women. If this sounds like a lot to you,  maybe look around. In the EU,   the average man drinks the equivalent of  almost 3 beers a day. The average woman,   almost 1. Similar figures  apply to much of the world,   especially the West. There is no other drug we  consume that gets so close to the edge of harm. It Isn’t Only Your Body Alcohol is unique for another reason:  its unmatched ability to destroy others. Alcohol causes a staggering amount of accidents.  The numbness and disinhibition of a few drinks   can morph you into a clumsy critter eager  to take really stupid risks – on a balcony,   at sea, or on the road. Every year,  alcohol-fueled accidents kill 500,000 people;   300,000 of them in car accidents. But  more than half of the people who died   in those crashes didn't drink. They  just died because someone else did. Alcohol is also one of the major causes of  violence, from fights at the pub to domestic   abuse, other brutal assaults and murder. Figures  differ by country, but essentially 50% of all   violent crime and sexual assault is committed by  drunk offenders. Each year, alcohol-fueled crime   kills about 100,000 people. That's a city like  Pisa being massacred every year by a drunk mob. And then you have all the non-lethal  victims. In England alone, 500,000   adults are injured every year in accidents  caused by drunk people. Another 800,000 get   hurt in violent attacks by drunk offenders.  Zoomed out to the rest of the drinking world,   this means that, every year, dozens of millions  are physically harmed by someone else's drinking. The most innocent bystanders are the 600,000  babies born every year with fetal alcohol   spectrum disorder, a devastating lifelong  condition caused by drinking during pregnancy. Alcohol is nothing short of a global catastrophe. The Final Toll – The  Hijacking of 400 Million Lives When your drinking escalates to a point that  it causes real harm to yourself or others,   you’ve crossed the invisible line to alcoholism.  An estimated 400 million people, 1 in 14 adults,   are in this territory. The line is very  fuzzy and varies from person to person.   But if you consistently drink 8 beers per week  as a woman, 15 as a man, or 5 on the same day,   you’ve either crossed the line or  are dangerously walking towards it. Of those 400 million, more than half have  fallen into an even deeper trap – dependence.   When alcohol has become something that  you physically or psychologically need.   In Europe and the Americas, 1 in  20 adults are caught in this web. The stereotype of alcoholism is one of  extremes. A homeless person clutching   a bottle or an always-drunk father shouting  at his kids. But it can be far more silent. A US study found that up to 50% of all  alcoholics may fly under the radar. They   come in two main groups: unproblematic young  adults, and middle-aged professionals with   successful careers and families. As  one of them you’ll show no antisocial   behavior. You’ll fulfill your obligations.  You’ll probably have no diagnosed health   conditions. But on average you’ll be having  4 beers a day and will get drunk every week. And neither you nor your family may notice. No  one questions a drink at dinner, after work,   or at a party. But it is exactly that  that makes alcohol so dangerous. No   other drug is so widely accepted,  casually consumed and easily ignored. So OK – How did we come to this? A Pact With the Devil We made a pact with alcohol to help us solve  one of the greatest challenges of being human. Human interaction is messy. We long for closeness.  But we are also anxious, awkward, and wary of each   other. “Am I talking too much?” “Do they actually  like me?” “What if I say something stupid?” There are many ways to navigate this, alcohol is  not “the” solution, but it is definitely one of   them. It is a real and effortless solution  to the problem of connecting with others.   Studies confirm what we have known for  millennia. Modest quantities of alcohol   help strangers bond. And individuals who  drink moderately and socially tend to   have more friends, closer friendships,  and higher levels of trust in others. So if we want to step away from alcohol, we  need to be honest about what we gain from it.   For millennia we’ve been giving it our health and  years of our lives. And in return, alcohol gave us   confidence, connection, and celebration.  But right now this is changing rapidly. Younger generations and especially Gen Z are  drinking far less than their parents did. In the   US, the share of 18-year-olds who have ever tried  alcohol has dropped by 25% in the last decades.   Binge drinking in adolescents has plummeted by  50%. And even in countries like Germany or France,   where beer and wine have always been part of the  cultural DNA, alcohol consumption is falling. And   that’s a victory. Fewer accidents. Fewer hospital  beds filled. Fewer lives quietly derailed. But at the same time, other things  have been falling too. The share of   young people who see their friends  almost every day has plummeted by   50%. Attendance at parties has fallen by  30%. Dating and casual sex have fallen   by a similar amount. All while loneliness  and mental health issues have skyrocketed. There are many different reasons for this, from  covid to social media. But the shift in which   drugs we consume is probably not totally unrelated  either. Drugs like weed have gained ground   massively and in contrast to drinking, smoking  weed tends to make many people less energetic   and likely to do things, more socially awkward and  especially if you use a lot of it, more lonely. Alcohol has been a powerful and influential tool  for sharing, celebrating and enjoying life with   others for thousands of years. If the West is  on the path to drinking less, we might also be   on the path to something completely new. A future  where we connect and rejoice without a poisonous   chemical crutch, or at least without this specific  one. It’s up to us to figure out what comes next. There are so many other ways to strengthen  your confidence and make connections:   By doing the things you are passionate  about. By working towards the future.   By investing time into your dreams  – like starting your own business.

7wK4peez9zE,Let's Kill You a Billion Times to Make You Immortal,,Educational,"You might be unkillable, impossible to delete   out of existence  – if one of the most exciting ideas about physics, quantum immortality, is   true. To test this idea, we will put a nuclear bomb in your living room. But more on that   later. This is real science happening around   one of the most successful theories of physics. To understand why, we need to tell you a story.  The story of the smallest parts in the universe, atoms and fundamental particles. With everyday objects things intuitively   make sense – if you kick a marble ten times with the same force and at the same   angle, it always lands in the same spot. But if you kick an electron ten times exactly   the same way, it shows up in different places. On the most fundamental   level of reality, randomness is the rule. The story that solves this is called quantum   mechanics. Simplified it goes something like this: A particle like an electron is not like a tiny   marble but like a shapeshifter – a diffuse thing we call a wave, that ebbs and flows. But to make   it much weirder: It’s not a wave of matter or energy, but a wave of probability – an immaterial   essence that has values between 0% and 100%. What does this even mean? Quantum mechanics doesn't really   tell us much about the electron. It only tells us how this entity that   we call an electron behaves on average. Say you shoot an electron gun at your   apartment. You shoot it 100 times – 80 times the electron shows up in your living   room, and 20 times in your kitchen. So the probability wave of our electron is 80%   in the living room and 20% in the kitchen. What is deeply annoying is that this story of   probability waves works insanely well in reality. It's not just some brainchild   that only works on paper. Scientists have tested it in countless   experiments and it works every single time. It explains how a lot of real things   work, from information passing through microchips to the atoms fusing in the center of   stars. And yet how can this story make sense? All of our other scientific stories give us a   mental picture of the things they are describing – a sphere of iron at the center of   earth, an elastic fabric of space. But a wave of probability?   What’s that even supposed to look like? Quantum mechanics doesn’t tell us   anything about the electron itself –  what it looks like, how it moves, or how it tastes. But if our story doesn’t describe the electrons   themselves, what does it describe and how does it potentially make you immortal? What Is the Quantum Story Really About? Scientists have been debating this for a   century. They’ve come up with tons of ideas we can’t cover here, but there are two popular   schools of thought. We’ll call them linguists and literary critics. They are screaming and arguing   over what the quantum story really means. The position of the linguists is “shut up and   calculate”. They basically claim that quantum mechanics is not a story about reality, but   just a kind of grammar for the theoretical language of the universe. With this language   we can predict experiments. Nothing else. If there is no story, there is no point in   asking what the story says about the electron. Whether electrons are tiny marbles or   clouds, waves of negative charge or Detective Pikachu is missing the point. Quantum mechanics   doesn’t enable you to visualize any electrons. All you can do is to run experiments.   And physics is all about experiments, not about creating mental pictures for us.   So shut up, stop imagining fairy tales, and just use the probability wave to calculate   things. Follow the grammar, ignore the plot. “Nooooo!” scream the literary critics: Read   between the lines, there’s a hidden meaning here! They are “many-worldians” and they   are convinced that quantum mechanics is a story about reality.   And they want to interpret the story. The many-worlds interpretation of quantum   mechanics is not the same as the multiverse by the way, which is a whole different can of worms,   but we’ll get to that another time. The many-worldians think that the universe   is an infinitely complex quantum state, where all physically possible outcomes   coexist simultaneously. If the probability wave of your electron is split 80% to 20%   between your living room and the kitchen, that means that the electron is split in   a similar way. That there are 5 versions of the electron – 4 of them are going to   the living room, and 1 to the kitchen. But it isn’t just the electron that   splits. You are observing the electron, so there are five versions of you, too! Four of them see the electron in   the living room, and one in the kitchen. Each of these different versions of you   and the electron are equally real, equally true. And all of them exist at this moment,   in your house. But they can’t communicate or interact in any way, so they are totally   invisible to each other. Which means that, whoever “you” are right now, you   are just one of your versions, experiencing just one thing – either seeing the   electron in the living room, or in the kitchen. Many-worlds means that all physically possible  worlds are coexisting right here, right now, but independently of each other, like the   branches of a tree. And there are a lot of them. Every possible quantum process   means there are other possible worlds. A radioactive atom decays? Another world exists   where it didn’t. A cosmic ray hits one of your cells? Another world exists where   the ray just passed through. Each second, bazillions upon bazillions of   new worlds exist on top of each other. “Stop it!”, shout the linguists. “If these   worlds can’t interact with each other, we can't check whether they exist! This is  not science. So please shut up and calculate…” Wait! There is a way to find out. But to do it, you’ll have to die a few hundred times.   And maybe prove that you are immortal!  The Ultimate Experiment All we need are two electron detectors   connected to a nuclear bomb in your living room. If the detector in your living room   is activated the nuke explodes. If the one   in the kitchen is activated you are safe.   Now sit on the nuke and have your brave   assistant shoot the electron gun. There are   two ways this can go. There is a 20% chance   the electron lands in the kitchen and   you survive, and an 80% chance you die. Ok, let’s shoot! Beep. Oh, lucky you! The electron landed   in the kitchen. Let’s try once more: Beep. And once again: Beep. And another 100 times! Beep, Beep, Beep, Beep, Beep, Beep, Beep… If there is only one universe, you’ll die fairly soon. Sooner rather than later the electron will trigger   the nuke and you’ll be instantly vaporized. But if the many worlds interpretation is true,   then every time your assistant shoots the gun, there are five versions of you and four   instantly die. Only one of your versions is alive and there’s only one thing   you can experience – your survival. It doesn’t matter how many times you try. From   your perspective, you will survive every time. At first it will seem like luck. But at some   point your “luck” will become near-impossible. In a universe with just one reality,   your odds of surviving 100 times in a row  are about 1 in ten duovigintillion  – a 1 followed by 70 zeroes. So if you did the experiment 100 times and you   are still here, the universe just whispered   its deepest secret to you. Yes, you killed   hundreds of versions of yourself. But you now know for sure that the many worlds are true.   Because you are still here experiencing things. And that you are kind of immortal! Okay, well, all that might be a bit  overwhelming - let’s break it down again. The Cosmic Secret If every possible quantum process   always happens in some branch, then this doesn’t only mean that   there are almost, but not quite, infinite versions of you – but there   is always a “you” that gets insanely lucky. A tumor starts, but a cosmic ray kills it before   it spreads. A bolt of lightning strikes at you,   but a quantum fluke makes it miss   by a meter. A washing machine falls   from a roof, but all its atoms   quantum-tunnel through your body. No matter how extremely high the   likelihood is that you will die, there may always be a branch in which you survive. So should you start wingsuit-flying today?   Well, not so fast. For every version of you that survives, bazillions don’t. And all those versions   of you are just as real as you are right now,   watching this video. So if you care about the  current version of yourself, you should care   just as much about all the versions still waiting   to be and their loved ones. In other words – if   you see a washing machine falling, better move   away and save as many of your versions as you can. The more universes exist with you in them the   better, your existence makes the universe richer. And there is another good reason to move. While the many-worlds interpretation of   quantum mechanics feels beautiful and elegant, that doesn’t make it true. We don’t know if   it’s true and so far no literary critic sat on a nuke to risk being wrong. If the “shut   up and calculate” people are right, there is just one world. Just one version of you. And if   the washing machine hits you, you are done for. But wouldn’t this be nice to know? If the many worlds idea is true,   then no matter how unlucky you get, you will always know that   somewhere, you are lucky. Quantum mechanics is an amazing tool to explore   different realities.

efOW5NUTYB8,When Your Body Attacks Itself – Autoimmune,,Educational,"Your immune system is an omnipresent, terrifying   entity made of billions of nuclear weapons and kamikaze bombers, saturating every   little tissue, bone and fluid in your body. It scans, patrols, and when it finds an enemy — it kills. But what if it suddenly decides   that you are the enemy? This is the betrayal of autoimmunity   – diseases like Type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, celiac disease,   lupus and Crohn's disease and many more. Literally every tissue can be affected, from   your nerves to your thyroid or joints. They are all unique and different kinds of bad,   from manageable to life changing to deadly. All share one fundamental property: Your immune   system thinks some healthy part of you is the enemy. It’s like a country attacking itself: fighter jets bomb roads, snipers hunt doctors and baristas, artillery levels daycare centers. While there is usually a certain amount   of genetic risk for autoimmunity, to get an actual autoimmune disease you also need   a colossal case of bad luck on top of that. How does this work? The Shape Of Life The fundamental building blocks of life are proteins. Like ultra complex lego blocks   each of them has a precise shape, allowing them to perform highly specific tasks, like breaking down food or transcribing DNA. In total your body produces  about 100,000 different proteins, or shapes. Your immune system evolved to constantly check   the proteins of your cells and look for shapes that are not you – and to kill whatever is   attached to them violently and brutally. Autoimmunity is when your soldier   cells suddenly think that your own healthy and natural proteins   belong to an enemy. We explained this in more detail   in this video – but in a nutshell: This is such a critical danger to your survival   that your body created an entire murder university to prevent this from happening. Here, young immune cells go   through ruthless training: if they recognize the shapes of your own   proteins, they are executed immediately. But sometimes through sheer, dumb   luck one makes it through. Right at this moment you probably have   a few million cells patrolling your body with the potential to trigger   an autoimmune disease. Another way to trigger autoimmunity   is through our enemies: Some bacteria and viruses have evolved proteins that   are extremely similar to the ones in your own body. Because they just have to if they want to   interact with your cells – and to stay hidden. We see this everywhere in nature, from moths that look   like bark or crocodiles that disappear in muddy water. For bacteria your tissue is a hostile jungle   full of angry predators looking for them. So they try to cover themselves in shapes   that are very similar to your proteins. But both of these things are not enough,   the final ingredient is a trigger event.  And a colossal case of bad luck. The War That Never Ends The trigger can be anything   that activates your defenses. A common cold, the flu, a tiny wound.  Any sort of infection floods   your body with cytokines, signals that tell your body “this is a   real fight, take this seriously” which truly wakes up your immune system.  Intelligence cells start to gather   proteins – shapes – from the battlefield. These shapes are the physical information of what   is going on and are carried to your lymph nodes, information distribution centers. Here, your heavy weapons – T cells – pass through,  taking a look at the shapes that are being presented here. If they recognize the shape of an invader  they activate the whole immune system and   a few days later the attacker will be wiped out. But this time the worst things   happen in the worst kind of way. Maybe an intelligence officer picked up a piece of   one of your healthy cells that died in the battle, or maybe a bacteria had a protein pretty similar   to one of yours. And by sheer, extremely bad luck, a few months ago a single T cell that can   recognize this shape survived the murder university. And today exactly this T cell happened   to pass exactly this lymph node and is activated. This single T cell now starts a big   immune reaction against your own body. It clones itself thousands of times, gathers other   cells for support and streams into your tissue. When the misguided immune cells arrive   they see nothing but enemies! The proteins they are looking for are everywhere!  Which can only mean that there   is a full on invasion going on! They spread out and start   attacking and killing your tissue. How bad is this? Well, it depends. There are more than 100 different autoimmune   diseases and basically any tissue can be affected. In Multiple Sclerosis your immune cells are   attacking the insulation of your nerve cells, making them sort of short circuit or  slow down dramatically. Causing numbness, muscle cramps, problems   with your vision and concentration.  In Type 1 Diabetes your immune system kills the   cells that produce your insulin in your pancreas, starving your cells of glucose and   turning your blood into acid. In Rheumatoid Arthritis angry cells invade your   joints and literally start to dissolve cartilage and bone. Lupus is a body-wide Blitzkrieg that attacks literally   every part of your body causing painful, unpredictable and widespread destruction   with a variety of bad symptoms. And almost all autoimmune diseases come   with crushing fatigue and exhaustion. Because when you are sick, your immune system   tells your body to shut down and rest. Even if the immune system is itself the attacker,   it still sends out the same orders. It feels like you have the flu but   the real enemy is your own body. The worst part about autoimmunity   is that it never stops.  Your immune system is a   self enforcing machine of destruction.  The more “enemies” your initial autoimmunity cells   encounter the more cells they clone and activate. So its nature prevents lasting peace. Why is your Body allowing this? Most, if not all, autoimmune diseases have a   genetic component but this is kind of weird. If some variants of genes are actively harmful to us,   evolution should weed them out and make them less common.  But up to one in ten people   in the industrialized world suffers from them. So why did they stick around? Well when it comes to genes, we often   have to work with trade offs –  at their core autoimmune diseases always mean   that your immune system is more aggressive –  and while this is mostly bad, until   recently in human history, this was pretty great. In the past infectious diseases were the   most common cause of death. Terrible pandemics ravaged our cities   regularly, sometimes decimating communities. Researchers analyzed DNA samples   from London cemeteries before,   during, and after the Black Death pandemic   that killed about half of the population. They found that individuals with gene variants   that increase the risk for Crohn’s disease, seemed to have died at a much lower rate. What helped them against a deadly disease back then   might make us vulnerable to autoimmunity today. Evolution doesn’t care about perfect solutions,   it is only looking for good enough. If variants made it more likely to   survive the deadliest diseases, why care if down the line this   might lead to something else? If you have an autoimmune disease you may only be   alive because your ancestors carried these genes and survived a pandemic that   wiped out their neighbours. And then a hot second ago   we changed our world. Hygiene, antibiotics, vaccines and modern   medicine revolutionized our lives and how we die. So much so that most of us don’t even think a lot   about infectious diseases – and this is great. But now we are left with genes that make our   immune systems more aggressive for no good reason. Add a bit of bad luck and all these billions of nuclear weapons and kamikaze bombers take aim at the wrong target: You.

CYlon2tvywA,The Small World Paradox,,Educational,"- In 1999, the German newspaper ""Die Zeit"" ran an experiment. They asked a falafel salesman and former theater director, Salah ben Ghaly, who in the world he would most like to be connected to. He chose his favorite actor, Marlon Brando. So the reporters then searched for a chain of friends, family or acquaintances, people who knew each other on a first name basis, who could connect ben Ghaly to Brando. As it happens, ben Ghaly had a friend in California. This friend worked alongside the boyfriend of a woman who was the sorority sister of the daughter of the producer of the film ""Don Juan DeMarco,"" starring Marlon Brando. So in total, it took just six steps, six degrees of separation. And the idea is that this is not a unique example, that you could connect any two people on the planet in six steps or less. But is it really true? And if it is, how does it affect our lives? - How is this possible in a world of now eight billion people that we could be that close, just six hops or less? Does that affect how diseases spread, how information travels? Our math showed, the question is not why is the world small, it's really how could it be otherwise? But then I got a call from the FBI. We are making the world smaller all the time. Like it's supposed to be good, and yet it does expose you to toxicity and malevolence that you might've been shielded from. - You look at the net effect of it, and it's actually been pretty negative by a lot of measures. People have suffered. - It's not only dangerous in terms of disease propagation, but anything malevolent now has conduits that it didn't used to have. - If we were all connected to everyone else on the planet completely at random, then it would be almost a mathematical certainty that any two of us would be connected through fewer than six steps. - Let's suppose I have my 100 friends out of eight billion people. Each of them knows 100 people. So two steps away from me is gonna encompass 100 times 100 people. That's already 10-to-the-fourth people. And so if you do 100 to the fifth power, that's 10 to the 10th, and that's more people than there are on Earth. So notice that number is five, I said, ""To the fifth power."" That's the ballpark reason why six degrees (laughing) of separation is true. - But the shocking thing about this is, the calculation you've just outlined is about having 100 friends at random out of 10 billion and they're all over the world, but we know that in the real world, that's nowhere near what the distribution of friends are like. - Yeah, absolutely true. So this really crude calculation I did is absurd, for the reason that you said. The world is very far from random. - The truth is people naturally cluster geographically. Most of the people you know live close to you, and they also have a higher probability of knowing each other. If you calculate the fraction of people you know who also know each other, that is a measure of the clustering in the network. So let's try a model with a high degree of clustering. Imagine all eight billion people on Earth are arranged into a circle, and say each person knows the 100 people closest to them. So 50 to the left and 50 to the right. Well, in this case, the furthest person you can connect to is just 50 people away. So if you wanted to connect to someone on the other side of the planet through a chain of people who know each other, well, it would take 80 million steps, and to connect any two people would take on average 40 million steps. Even just getting 10% to the way there would take eight million steps. And six steps would get you, well, here. (inquisitive music) This is the paradox of six degrees of separation. We know that we live in these local clusters of friends and acquaintances, but we also seem to be able to connect anyone anywhere in just six steps. 10 years ago, I did my own experiment on this, and I found that the average Veritasium viewer was only 2.7 degrees of separation from me. In social science, this is known as the small-world problem, named after the phenomenon where you're say on holiday somewhere and you bump into a stranger who somehow knows your best friend, and you say, ""Wow, it's such a small world."" (light music) In the mid-1990s, two mathematicians, Duncan Watts and Steve Strogatz, set out to solve this small-world problem. - Duncan really sort of had very far-seeing imagination at that point. - We had computers that allowed us to simulate environments that were too complicated for for math to work. - [Derek] Up until then, physicists had studied networks that were ordered and regular, like crystal lattices. And mathematicians, like Paul Erdos, had done lots of work on totally random networks, but no one had studied what happens in between. - There must be some enormous middle ground, and that's what Duncan and I felt like we're starting to explore. - [Derek] To study this middle ground, Watts and Strogatz imagined a simple regular network of people, or nodes, dotted around a circle, each connected to a few of their nearest neighbors. - And so we had this idea, ""We're gonna start with the physicist end of regular, and now we're gonna turn the randomness knob to make it more and more random through these random shortcuts."" - [Derek] We all have some experience with shortcuts. - I belonged to this club called the Internet Chess Club. I got to be very friendly with a guy in Holland. That connection makes the world small, because now, even though my friends don't realize it, they're only one step away from a guy in Holland. And so that kind of connection where you sort of connect to someone outside your normal circle is what we came to call a shortcut. - [Derek] So they went round the circle, disconnecting some of the links and reconnecting them at random to a different node in the network. And as they did that, they watched what happened to the average number of steps it took to get from any one node in the network to another, hopping between connected nodes. In other words, the degree of separation. - This is now the moment for the big reveal. As Duncan turned the knob in his computer simulations, as soon as he introduced a few shortcuts, the world immediately gets as small as a random graph. - [Derek] When they had rewired just 1% of the links to shortcuts, the average degree of separation dropped from 50 in the original fully ordered network to 10. But Watts and Strogatz also tracked how clustered the network was. That's the fraction of a node's connections that are also connected to each other, or in other words, the fraction of my friends who are also friends with each other. What they found is that clustering remained high for much longer. - The world immediately gets as small as a random graph, but it stays as clustered as if it were still regular. So you could simultaneously have the clustering that we know is real and the small world that we know is real. - Now, in Watts and Strogatz's model, they looked at 1,000 nodes, but if you apply their model to the eight billion people on Earth, well, then you would only need three out of every 10,000 friendships to be a shortcut, and the average degrees of separation drops to six. - Our math showed, the question is not why is the world small, it's really how could it be otherwise? Duncan started saying to me, ""This is about discovering a whole new universe, and its properties and laws."" I recognized that he was right. - I just wanted to sort of reflect on what you said about these sort of shortcuts. I think I've had this phenomenon happen to me sometimes in my life where I'm sort of invited to an event and it seems like a very random event. Often I kind of feel like, (sighing) ""I don't really wanna go."" (Steven laughing) ""You know, none of my friends are going."" But then, maybe at the last minute, I just say like, ""Well, let's just roll the dice."" And I find that almost invariably those are productive meetings. I'm kind of wondering if there's a takeaway for people here, which is that they should put themselves in situations where the probability of forming these shortcut links, would it sort of increase the luck in your life? - You have just put your finger on a very famous phenomenon in sociology that is called the strength of weak ties. 'Cause you ask people how they got their job, and people would say, ""Oh yeah, I heard about it from, you know, Randy."" And then he'd say, ""Oh, is Randy a friend of yours?"" and people invariably would say, ""No, he's an acquaintance. I wouldn't call him a friend, he's an acquaintance."" That's a weak tie. The strong tie is your best friend or your circle of friends. - [Derek] Excited about their breakthrough, Watts and Strogatz wanted to test their small-world model on some real-world data, but this was 1996. - [Steven] We had to think, ""Well, where are we gonna get data on big networks where we could test this?"" And it was not so easy, the internet was not mapped out, Google didn't exist. - [Derek] So they turned to an unusual source. - [Steven] There was only one nervous system that had been mapped at that time, which was the worm, C. elegans. Tiny worm, like a millimeter, that you can find in the dirt. A favorite of neurobiologists. They knew every cell in the body of C. elegans from the time it's a single cell 'til it becomes a whole organism. So they had the total wiring diagram of that organism. - [Derek] Watts and Strogatz tested their model on the worm's neural network. The worm has precisely 282 neurons, and on average, they're connected to 14 others. If you lay that all out in a line along the worm's body, the neurons at the ends would be separated by around 40 steps, and the average degree of separation would be around 14. But when Watts and Strogatz ran the calculations, they found the average degrees of separation between any two neurons was just 2.65. To put that in context, if they were connected totally at random, it would be 2.25. - [Steven] And yes, okay, so bingo, that was a small world. Then we were popping the champagne. I mean, that was really exciting that nature had done that. So then we thought, ""Well, okay, but this should be true of lots of networks because nature can't resist this mechanism."" - [Derek] So they looked at Hollywood actors and power grids across the US. Sure enough, they were both small-world networks. For example, in the database of over 200,000 Hollywood actors, the average degree of separation was less than four. Dangerfield was in ""Caddy Shack"" with Bill Murray, and Bill Murray was in ""She's Having a Baby"" with Kevin Bacon. - [Steven] Then the real payoff for us, as people interested in dynamical systems more than graph theory, was, ""Okay, so what? You know, so what if the world is small? Does that affect how things get in sync? Does it affect how diseases spread? Does it affect how information travels? Whatever."" And so we did a number of experiments, again, in the computer, like that. - [Derek] Take disease. I wanted to know how a few shortcuts would affect how disease spreads through a network. So I asked Casper and the team to make a simulation. - [Casper] And then the question to you is, do you wanna start with a completely regular world where it's completely clustered or do you wanna start with completely random? - [Derek] I would start with a regular world. - [Casper] Okay. There it goes. - [Derek] There's the spread of infections. - [Casper] Yeah. - Wow. - So it takes over the world, completely. Well, if every step was a day, it would take 73 days for the, you know, infection to take over this entire world. - [Derek] Well, let's introduce a few shortcuts and see. - [Casper] Okay, let's make it small world, like 10%. Let's go. - [Derek] Boom. Wow, that's really dramatic. - (laughing) Whoa. Right? - That's really dramatic and very fast. - Yeah, so fast. Yeah, after 26 days, the whole world. - [Derek] And that ramp up does look exponential at the beginning. - Right? - And then it kind of looks linear there as well, but it's almost like you can't go any faster. - [Casper] Yeah. Okay, so now let's make it a completely random network. (inquisitive music) - [Derek] Boom. - Boom. - Crazy. How many days now for a fully random network? - [Casper] 25. - [Derek] Basically identical. - [Casper] Which is crazy because in the random case, all your links are random. You know, in the small-world case, it's just 10%. It's like if one out of your 10 friends are a shortcut, which, you know, for some people might be a bit much, but I reckon for you, it's probably about right. - [Derek] Yeah, I got lots of shortcuts. (Casper laughing) - [Casper] But the crazy thing is that in this simulation, we only use 100 nodes. And if you use the same model to the eight billion people on Earth, then you would actually need less than 1% of all your links to be shortcuts. - [Derek] In 1998, Watts and Strogatz published their findings in a three-page article in ""Nature,"" and the paper took off. Within a few years, the paper already had hundreds of citations. By 2014, it was ranked the 63rd-most-cited paper of all time. And today, it's got around 58,000 citations. That's higher than Peter Higgs' paper on the Higgs boson, and almost three times as many as Watson and Crick's Nobel Prize-winning paper on DNA. - [Steven] So it's probably worth making that distinction that citations are one measure of impact. We're cited a lot more than Einstein, and I think you know who's more important? (Derek laughing) It's not us, but it does mean people thought it was worth citing. We had many tens of thousands of citations from people in far-flung fields, from neuroscience, to sociology, to graph theory, to computer science. Even, you know, English literature, people would do things like draw networks between words. - [Derek] Is there any irony in the fact that this paper on global networks goes viral itself? - [Steven] (laughing) Yes, I think so, maybe so. (record scratching) - [Derek] But then things got a little weird. - [Steven] That's when I started getting some strange phone calls. I got a call from somebody at the FBI. I was a little scared, ""What's the FBI calling me about?"" And so I called back, and the person who picks up says, ""Hair and Fiber."" (laughing) I was calling the Hair and Fiber network at the FBI, the people who do you know criminology based on what telltale hairs or fibers are left on the victim's clothes after they've been murdered. There was a guy who said, ""What happens when the police have a suspect and they say, ""You have fibers on your sweater that match the hair of the victim,"" and then the defense lawyer says, ""Well, you know, maybe the victim was on a bus and left her fibers on the bus, and then my client sat on the, a secondary transfer,"" they would call it, ""of these fibers, that doesn't prove anything?"" So the FBI wanted to know, what's the probability of secondary transfers compared to primary transfers from actually killing the person? And like I said, ""Well, I don't, what do I know now?"" (Steven and Derek laughing) - [Derek] Now, that's a Steve Strogatz problem. For most of us, a random caller telling you they're an FBI agent is probably a scam. Chances are they got your number from a data leak or a data broker. Anytime you provide your name, phone number, even your Social Security number, that personal information can be scraped, packaged and sold to anyone who will pay.

In 1998, Albert-Laszlo Barabasi was studying the internet. At that time, there were around 800 million webpage, but despite the web's enormous size, Barabasi found that on average you could connect any two sites with just 19 clicks. Apparently the web was a small world too, but the strange thing was, it didn't look anything like the small-world network in Watts and Strogatz's model. - [Albert-Laszlo] We ended up mapping out a region of World Wide Web, and we had a very clear expectation of how that network should look like. - [Derek] Barabasi thought the distribution of pages and links would resemble a bell curve, similar to what you'd get for people's height across a population. Most sites would have some average number of links and there would be very few outliers either side. But that is not what he saw. (inquisitive music) - [Albert-Laszlo] And so we measured the distribution, and it didn't look anything like what we expected. (laughing) - [Derek] The curve started out steep. Loads of websites had not many links. Then there was this really long tail. - [Albert-Laszlo] And here we saw webpages that had not only a little more, but sometimes 100 times more links than the average degree or the average node on the website. - [Derek] These were websites like Yahoo, super-connectors that linked to thousands of other sites. Barabasi called them hubs, because when he mapped out the network, they resembled the hub of a wheel, with spokes going out to hundreds of other pages. And it was these hubs that made the web a small world, not shortcuts. So Barabasi wondered, ""How could this apply to other networks too?"" - [Albert-Laszlo] Most real networks, or virtually all large networks, follow two very fundamental principles. First, any large network out there never pops out as a large network, but it grows, right? You have a tiny World Wide Web in 1991, and now we have trillions of nodes on the World Wide Web. How did we get one to a trillion? One node at a time, one website at a time. All the networks out there, no matter how old, how fast they emerged, they always emerged with some kind of growth process. So if you think about networks, you must build in that growth process. Number two, when a new node comes in, you join Facebook, whom you gonna connect to, right? And it is somewhat unpredictable, but it's biased. Your connections are always biased towards the more connected nodes, simply because you are more likely to know more connected node than less connected node. We named this process preferential attachment. - [Derek] Barabasi reasoned that these two principles could explain how hubs naturally emerge when a network grows. So together with his colleague, Reka Albert, he ran a simulation. - [Casper] We've also got a simulation for this. They started with a simple network of just a few connected nodes. Then they begin adding new nodes to the network one at a time, with just one condition, they'd be more likely to connect the nodes that already had more links. - [Derek] That's so cool. Looks very biological, very organic. Also, I like how the nodes come out and they don't just sort of stop in one spot, they kind of like wiggle around and like find their location. I really like enjoy this. Kind of like a space station. - [Casper] That's what I was thinking. - [Derek] Or like a space colony, right? - [Casper] Yeah, yeah, right? Like each little center one could be a planet, then you've got all the sort of stations going around it. - [Derek] Yes. - [Casper] So when Barabasi and Albert let these networks evolve, hubs emerged. - [Albert-Laszlo] And we showed that growth and preferential attachment together naturally lead to the emergence of hubs. - [Derek] With this simulation, Barabasi and Albert showed how hubs could emerge in virtually any complex network. Take airports for example. In 1955, Chicago O'Hare opened to commercial flights. Unlike neighboring airport, Midway, it had long runways and plenty of space for new jet aircraft. Airlines began shifting service there. As more airlines connected flights to O'Hare, passengers had more options to connect, making it increasingly attractive. After deregulation in the 1970s, more airlines were free to add routes and the feedback loop accelerated. Each new route made the airport more useful to passengers and more appealing to other airlines. Today, O'Hare is the most connected airport in the United States, with direct flights to well over 200 destinations. - [Casper] But we don't just see hubs in manmade networks. In food webs, you have a few keystone species, like Atlantic cods, that connect hundreds of predators and prey. And in the metabolic networks in our cells, you have a few molecules, like ATP, that govern hundreds of chemical reactions. In the neural networks in our brain, you have a few regions, like the prefrontal cortex that link hundreds of different functions. Now, as each of these networks evolved and grew over time, you had new species, new reactions and new circuits that latched on to what was already well connected. And so you get this sort of natural growth. Now, preferential attachment isn't the only mechanism that can create hubs. There are plenty of other factors at play, particularly in these more complex biological systems. But what Barabasi's and Albert's simulation showed is that all it takes is a tiny bias when growing a network and hubs end up being inevitable. - [Albert-Laszlo] Once hubs are there, they fundamentally change (laughing) the way the system behaves and the way we understand that system. - [Derek] Hubs like O'Hare mean you can get pretty much anywhere in the world in just a few flights. But that connectivity also has consequences. In August, 2025, thunderstorms shut down Chicago O'Hare, and 280 flights were canceled and 80 were diverted. Overflow hit at least six other US airports. While some planes stuck in Chicago never left for Europe or Asia. - [Albert-Laszlo] Bad weather in Chicago totally changes not only the the travel pattern in Chicago, but within 24 hours, the whole country is being affected by that. - [Derek] And we see the same phenomenon in natural networks, knocking out one keystone species, like Atlantic cod, can destabilize an entire ecosystem. - [Albert-Laszlo] So this is what we call the Achilles' heel of networks. And this could be good news or it could be bad news, right? Good news if you wanna create drugs to kill bacteria, then you're gonna go for the hub. - [Derek] This idea has created a whole new field of network medicine where researchers develop drugs to target crucial parts of a disease's metabolic network. But understanding the role of hubs doesn't just help develop cures for a disease, it can help us control its spread. (inquisitive music) In 1990, Thailand was facing one of the fastest-growing HIV epidemics in the world. The government tried broad campaigns, like posters, TV ads and school talks, telling everyone to use condoms. But the infection kept spreading. So in 1991, the government tried something different. They started targeting hubs. They told brothels around the country that every client must use a condom or else they'd be shut down. And the impact was huge. For example, HIV infections among young men joining the military dropped by more than 50%. And by 2013, Thailand's Ministry of Public Health estimated the policy had prevented over five million infections. All because they realized the importance of hubs. (upbeat music) - [Casper] Hubs and shortcuts make any complex network more connected than it seems. That means things spread quickly, whether that's airport delays, information or disease. But could that impact run even deeper? I mean, could the structure of our social network influence our very behavior and beliefs without us even being aware of it? - [Derek] Back in 1997, Watts and Strogatz investigated just that, using a game called the prisoner's dilemma. It's probably the most famous problem in game theory, and it's used to represent a ton of different conflicts we see in the real world. We've actually done a full video on it before, but here's a quick recap. The premise is simple. A banker with a chest full of gold invites you and another player to play. You each get two choices, you can cooperate or defect. If you both cooperate, you each get three coins. But if you defect while your opponent cooperates, you get five coins and they get nothing. And if you both defect, then you each get one coin. So what would you do? Suppose your opponent cooperates, then you could also cooperate and get three coins, or you could defect and get five coins instead. So you're better off defecting. But what if your opponent defects? Well, you could cooperate and get no coins or you could defect and at least get one. So no matter what your opponent does, your best option is always to defect. Now, if your opponent is also rational, they'll reach the same conclusion and therefore they'll also defect. And as a result, when you both act rationally, you both end up in the suboptimal situation of getting one coin each when you could have gotten three. (bright music) But in 1980, Professor Robert Axelrod found that if you play your opponent hundreds of times, well, then cooperation wins out. He ran a tournament among the world's leading game theorists and all the most successful strategies were nice. The winning strategy was called tit for tat, because its default position was to cooperate and it would only defect in retaliation. He also showed that a small cluster of cooperators can work together to overcome a world of defectors. - [Casper] So that's kind of the scene we're setting, right? You get to this realistic place where you get tit-for-tat life strategies to sort of dominate the world, because in Axelrod's tournament, every strategy played against every other strategy, or they only interacted sort of with their near neighborhood, which is, you know, the small cluster. And now you could wonder, ""Well, what if we start changing the way this works? What if we put them on a network?"" - [Derek] Well, Watts and Strogatz simulated their own version of the prisoner's dilemma that did just that. They set up a regular network where each player was connected to a few players on either side. Then they would simultaneously play against all of their connections. The rules were simple. If most of a player's connections cooperated, then that player would also cooperate. But if most of their connections defected, then they would defect in retaliation. They started with a small cluster of cooperators surrounded by defectors, and they watched the network evolve. Over time, what they saw was cooperation spread, just like what Axelrod had found. But then they reran the simulation, this time with a few links rewired to shortcuts. And all of a sudden, the cooperators were crushed and they ended up with a world of defectors. (defectors whirring) And when they started from a totally regular network and gradually increased the fraction of shortcuts, they found there was this critical fraction beyond which the percentage of cooperators at the end of the game drops to zero. - I think the thing that's really crazy is that you've taken the exact same strategies with all the same properties, same character traits and personalities, if you will, and you're not changing any of that. All you're changing is the way they're connected, and you go from a world where everyone's completely nice and working together to one where it's filled with nastiness and people betraying each other, only by changing how they're connected. - [Derek] It's like if the bulk of your interactions are sort of negative, then you start being negative too and you just contribute to the overall negativity. Whereas if like a few people are nice, and you can imagine, ""Oh, that makes me feel good and so I'm gonna be nicer to that person."" - [Steven] The intuition for that is that cooperation is fostered by having little clumps. If I have a little clump of people that are kind of my buds, we get to have a lot of encounters, and cooperation tends to emerge from familiarity, the same way that iteration helps, that if I know that I'm gonna see you again, I'm gonna encounter you again, it ends up being to my advantage to cooperate. Whereas like the world of the internet, where anyone can get on Twitter and badmouth anyone else, that tends to discourage. We don't have pockets, you don't have communities. - [Derek] It kind of explains this keyboard warrior phenomenon, and that, yeah, people say things on the internet they wouldn't say to-- - They wouldn't. Most people are nice in real life. - [Derek] (laughing) Yeah. - [Steven] It's funny that the small world, I know, you'd think the small world's, well, 'cause it's a Disney song, right? ♪ It's a small world after all ♪ Like it's supposed to be good, and yet it does expose you to toxicity and malevolence that you might've been shielded from in the small town. Social media has kind of been toxic. The initial idea being 'hey we connect up a bunch of people and people who have been separated geographically we connect you with your old friends.' You look of the net effect of it and it's actually been pretty negative by a lot of measures. Intrigued by the findings, Watts started wondering if the results applied to the real world too. For years after I did this work I had wanted to test the hypothesis with actual human subjects So he got some volunteers  to play a similar game called the public goods game  across different network structures He was expecting that,  like they found previously, more shortcuts in a network, would make cooperation less likely to emerge. But what he found was,  the structure of the network had no effect. Cooperation was just as likely to emerge  in a totally clustered network as it was in a totally random one. - [Duncan] We were very puzzled by this result. And then we kind of did some more work. - [Derek] When Watts dug deeper, he realized that the network structure did matter. In the more clustered networks, people were more likely to copy each other.  So if by chance someone started out cooperating, then everyone would cooperate. But it was equally likely  that someone would start out by defecting, in which case everyone else would defect. And over all the games they played, these two effects canceled each other out, which is why it seemed like the network structure didn't matter. - [Duncan] It's sort of on a knife edge, right? Where like one person does something selfish and everything goes south. In another world, everybody kind of holds it together and everything goes well.  It's crazy that the world could be like on a knife edge like that, you know, could tip one way or the other, kind of just depends on how someone gets out of bed that day. But then Watts realized something. See, in real life, you can choose who you hang out with. So he reran the experiment allowing players to change who they were playing with. And this time he used the prisoner's dilemma so that players could easily identify the defectors. - [Derek] And the finding was clear, the more you allowed players to choose who they were playing with, the more likely they were to cooperate. - [Casper] You can make this a lot better for yourself by just acting and being decisive and being proactive about things. - [Derek] Yeah, yeah, it's a thing I try  to teach my kids too, like if someone's annoying you, just ignore them. Like there's nothing to be gained by continuing to interact with people who are bringing negativity into your life. - [Casper] In fact, making a choice can be powerful in more than one way. There's something about the world that makes it prone to those upheavals. Meaning it's always kind of poised on an edge of instability. And that gives each of us more power than you'd think we would have. It is actually possible for individual people to start movements that grow and take off. And ultimately, if you look at history, that is what happens. It's always one person who is stubborn and does something that leads to 10 people, 1,000 people, and things change because of it. It always starts with one person somehow. It's the Steve Jobs quote, rig",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
t? The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do. And the wonderful thing is, it all starts with you believing you have that power. - Yeah Learning all about network science has taught me many things, but perhaps the most important is that our networks shape us, but our actions shape the networks. So choose both wisely. - [Casper] Hey, if you made it this far, all the simulations we ran through with Derek, we will actually make them available on a website that you can go to so you can play around with them yourself. So thank you so much for watching, we really appreciate it.

onr80iOoEXs,This liquid is too dangerous to transport,,Educational,"Most people don't know the real story of Alfred Nobel. (dramatic music) One morning in 1888, Alfred Nobel sat down to read the newspaper in his conservatory. He scanned the pages casually, but then, he froze. The Merchant of Death is dead. Dr. Alfred Nobel, who became rich by finding ways to kill more people faster than ever before, died yesterday. It was his own obituary. The newspaper had made a mistake. Alfred's older brother Ludwig had died in France, and the journalists had confused the two. (dramatic music) But in that moment, he saw exactly how the world would remember him, not as an inventor, but as a butcher. Now, the wording in the obituary, the Merchant of Death and all that, well, it's likely been exaggerated over the years. We could only find an obituary that described him as a man who can hardly be passed off as a benefactor of humanity. But reading this allowed Alfred to see what others truly thought of him, and it wasn't good. He had earned his reputation building an empire on one substance. Nitroglycerin. It's one of the most powerful explosives in the world. Its blast pressure is over 100 times greater than gunpowder. (explosion booms) - Oh my God. Woo! Oh, that's so sick. But that power comes at a price. Nitroglycerin is so sensitive that if it's dropped, shaken, or even just bumped, it can detonate. And as a result, hundreds of workers died trying to handle it. So Alfred made it his mission to tame this beast. But in doing so, he created powerful new explosives used in everything from blasting tunnels to making bombs, tools that transformed the modern world, but also contributed to deaths of tens of thousands of people, unleashing a level of destruction that would come to define him. (ground rumbles) Alfred's father, Immanuel was also an inventor. He opened the first ever rubber factory in Sweden and invented the rotary lathe, which made modern plywood possible. But Immanuel struggled with business. He went bankrupt shortly after Alfred was born. So Immanuel set off to Russia to start over, leaving his family behind. Some of Alfred's earliest memories were of watching his brothers sell matches on the street corners of Stockholm just to afford food. He was often sick, bedridden with colds, stomach problems, and bouts of depression. He would later say, ""Mine was a pitiful half-life, which ought to have been extinguished by some compassionate doctor as I yelled my way into the world."" But soon after Alfred turned nine, a letter arrived from his father asking the family to join him in St. Petersburg. In the early 1850s, the great powers of Europe were gearing up for war. And Immanuel spotted an opportunity. He realized Russia's capital was vulnerable to attack from the sea. So he approached Tsar Nicholas I with plans for a new kind of explosive device, one that would float in the harbor and detonate on contact with enemy ships. A sea mine. (explosion booms) Within months of his proposal in the Black Sea just off Sinope, the Russian Navy sank an ottoman fleet, and the Crimean war began. Immanuel's invention was suddenly in high demand, and the newly established Nobel armaments factory quickly grew from a few dozen employees to over 1,000, producing mines, torpedoes and other explosives for the Russian military. With money now pouring in, Immanuel decided to invest in Alfred's education. At the age of 17, Alfred found himself in a lab in Paris studying under the world's greatest chemists. And it's here that he met an Italian doctor named Ascanio Sobrero who had a peculiar demonstration. Sobrero would take an ordinary looking piece of cotton and lay it on an anvil. He would raise his hammer and. (mysterious music) - Whoa. (laughs) It's like a bird ran into a window. - That was a good one, right? - Yeah, that was a great one. - Soaked into that cotton was a new explosive material, nitroglycerin, and it was unlike anything the world had ever seen before. See, until then, the most commonly used explosive was gunpowder. But it had a major drawback. It's fast, but it's not that fast. When we were doing it, it was much slower than the speed of sound. - Ah! - Jesus! - That's because all the ingredients you need, the carbon for fuel, the potassium nitrate for oxygen and the sulfur to speed up the reaction, they are all in separate grains. And if they're spread far apart, their reaction is just too slow. Come on, you can do it. Go. But if you contain gunpowder, that forces these reactants closer together. And it also traps in heat, which accelerates the reaction. And this allows the pressure from the hot gases to build up until. (explosion booms) (playful music) - You see the explosion and then the powder burst out. - No way. - And then it catches flames. - Yeah. - You can see the whole bottom comes out, and then it just catches up to it. All these particles have to be in close proximity, and they also have to be small enough, and they have to be mixed well enough to get this reaction. So it kinda feels a little bit clunky. Like it's not the ideal way you'd wanna do this, where it's like all the molecules are actually like right next to each other. - That's a great instinct. Putting all the molecules beside each other so that you'd have them all available to react as quickly as possible. But I think I can one up that. And that is, can you put everything you need in the same molecule? - Okay. - And that's what nitroglycerin does. - No way. - Yeah. Yeah. - Okay, right? Pretty cool. - That is way cooler. And because of that, it's way more powerful. We've loaded 15 grams of gunpowder and 15 grams of nitroglycerin into test tubes, and then set them in clay blocks so we can compare their destructive power. - This is a bikini gauge for measuring blast over pressure. And it's called the bikini gauge in reference to the bikini atoll because a analog blast over pressure measurement device was used in the nuclear tests in the bikini atoll. It has a number of different diameter holes and a film inside. - [Narrator] The larger circles have more area, and so under the same pressure, they will experience more force and so burst first. The smaller circles take more pressure to break because they've got smaller area. - The smaller the circle that gets punctured means the higher the blast over pressure. - Okay, black powder into clay. - Fire in the hole! Three, two, one. (explosion booms) Yeah, it launched the block a bit. Popped the top right off. - Let's look at the bikini gauge, which looks totally intact. - Looks totally intact. - Yeah. I mean, I'm getting nothing, yeah. - All right. - So, we'll see if we'll leave that for the nitro. When the nitroglycerin goes off, it's gonna be like someone shooting a 50 cal. So I don't know if you've been to the range, but that's gonna be a big blast. (mysterious music) Fire in the hole! Five, four, three, two, one. - Oh. Oh my God. (explosion booms) So first thing I noticed is there are bits of clay that have just rained down on me. I got bits of blue all over me. That's crazy, right there. Is there anything left? - Yeah, there is a bunch of clay on this window, on that window, on this window, on bikini gauge. - It's like a Jackson Pollock painting. (mysterious music) There's no way we've got a frame there. There's just instant white. Joosh When it's fast on the phantom, then it's fast. - (laughs) Right. - Nitroglycerin is incredibly powerful and it gets this power from its molecular structure. See, nitroglycerin is a highly unstable molecule. It consists of a chain of three carbon atoms with three oxygens, and then three nitro groups attached to those, which are just nitrogen atoms bonded to two oxygen atoms. These nitro groups are what makes nitroglycerin so unstable. Oxygen is more electronegative than nitrogen. So these two oxygen atoms pull on the electrons from the nitrogen, which shifts the electron density away from this third oxygen. But now there's little shared electron density between these two atoms, which results in a much weaker bond between the nitro groups and the main chain. So you get these weak spots, and all it takes is a little bit of energy, like from the shock created by hammer strike and then those bonds snap apart. So now you've got all these atoms that are swapping partners, and they form much more stable products like nitrogen gas, carbon dioxide, and water vapor. And this process releases a huge amount of energy and heat, and it shoots off the products at high velocities. So then these go on to hit other nitroglycerin molecules, which causes their bonds to break. And if this happens for enough molecules at once, well, it sets off a chain reaction. - Now you've got a shockwave, and now it's going to propagate. And as it propagates through, it's gonna break bonds here, here, here, here, here. - [Henry] Its blast pressure is over 100 times greater than the peak pressures that are produced by gunpowder. - Lots of things will explode even, you know, you pop a balloon and that's an explosion. But the specific kind of explosion we're interested in with nitroglycerin is a detonation. And the detonation is that chemical decomposition that happens faster than the speed of sound in the material. - What we see in our experiments with nitroglycerin is all these things happen really fast. Like less than 100 femtoseconds fast. - I don't operate in femtosecond seconds very frequently. How fast is that? - Well, femtosecond 10 to negative 15 seconds. - That's crazy. So a molecule of nitroglycerin will decompose 3 trillion times faster than the blink of an eye. And it's this speed that is one of the defining characteristics of high explosives. - Yet, Sobrero never set out to discover an explosive. He was searching for a medicine to improve blood flow. During one test, he mixed glycerol with nitric and sulfuric acid, when suddenly, it exploded. (explosion booms) Sobrero survived but shards of glass left permanent scars on his face. Deeply shaken, he concluded this new substance, nitroglycerin, was just too dangerous. He later wrote, ""I am almost ashamed to admit to be its discoverer."" But Alfred disagreed. To him, the hammer strike was like a pistol shot. It was like somebody had kicked open the door to his mind. - It's a real shift in his character. 'cause he is been this frail, sickly boy, kind of has trouble with people. And then he discovers explosives and chemistry and it changes. You know, it's like whenever he is working, he finally isn't depressed. You know, he can kind of escape through his work. - And you know, at that age, you're probably not thinking about all the possible consequences of this. You're just sort of excited about what it can do. Far from fearing its power, he believed he'd be the one to unlock it and solve one of nitroglycerin's greatest problems. - If I had a jar sitting right here and I wanted to detonate it, how do I do that? - Need a long fuse. - But what's crazy about nitroglycerin is that a regular flame won't cause it to ignite. So even if I ran a fuse into that vial, it's not gonna explode. See, while a fuse can heat nitroglycerin, which makes its molecules vibrate faster, and it might even break a few no bonds, it usually doesn't break enough of them at the same time to detonate the rest of the liquid. So it doesn't explode. However, if you drop it. (explosion booms) But even that effect isn't consistent. We tried putting a vial loose in the back of this RC truck, expecting the bumpy ride to trigger it. (playful music) And nothing. - Whoa! - Ah! - It always seems to be blowing up when you don't want it to, and you can't really get it to blow up when you want it to. - That's very paradoxical. (explosion booms) - (laughs) You know, my browser used to look like a blast site too. I had windows and tabs scattered like debris. I had YouTube, Wikipedia, random research articles. Some things that I swear I never opened. But that changed when I switched to today's video sponsor, Opera. With its free built-in AI tool, Aria, I can use the quick shortcut to write a prompt, and then the chaos is gone. I can say close all my YouTube tabs and it's done. Or I can say, group my chemistry papers and it creates this tab island. I can even hover one tab over another tab. Boom, another island. Can expand and collapse them as needed to save space and stay organized. I also love that I can ask Aria anything while researching like, what year did Alfred Nobel patent dynamite in England? And I get the answer instantly without having to switch tabs. It's really helpful when Derek is patiently waiting for the next version of my script. (laughs) If I'm going through an article and wanna take notes, I can just drag one tab down, split the screen, and now I can do both. No need for multiple browser windows. And if I feel like listening to some music in the background, Opera's got a floating music player built into the sidebar. It makes controlling my music easy. I can access my favorite streaming service from anywhere, even while leaving the browser. So if you want a browser that helps you get stuff done, try opera for free by clicking the link in our description, thanks to opera for sponsoring this video. And now, back to some explosions. (mimics explosion) - In 1852, when Alfred returned to Russia, he moved into a cramped apartment with his brother Robert, and he turned their kitchen into a makeshift lab. He was searching for a reliable way to detonate nitroglycerin, dreaming it could one day power his father's sea mines. But when the Crimean war ended in 1856, the Russian government refused to honor the contracts they'd signed during the war. So the Nobel factory was forced to shut down, and Immanuel went bankrupt for the second time. Alfred later wrote that his father was, quote, ""A man of genius, but a failure all the same."" And so Alfred goes back to Sweden and he decides, he's like, ""I'm not gonna make the mistakes of my father."" Where does his mind go? Sticking with nitroglycerin. He's like, ""If I can make this, you know, I'll be successful on my own terms."" By the summer of 1862, a 28-year-old Alfred thought he was onto something. Excited, he gathered his brothers by the banks of Lake Malaren just behind his workshop in Stockholm, and he pulled out a metal tube with a fuse extending from the top. He ignited it and tossed it into the water. (explosion booms) (Henry laughs) That's crazy. He had finally found a way to reliably detonate nitroglycerin, and its finished form, it works something like this. Alfred took a container of nitroglycerin and inserted a wooden plug and packed it with gunpowder. Then when the fuse was lit, the gunpowder inside would explode, blasting down into the container. And it was that sudden impact that delivered the shock needed to detonate the nitroglycerin. It was just like the hammer striking the anvil. We need a blasting cap for this. All right, so now Jesse's gonna add a blasting cap. Alfred Nobel's first major adventure. (excited music) I could just like, my heart is just racing more than usual. And I know that it's safe, but yeah, I actually didn't really expect to feel this nervous about it. - Fire in the hole! Fire in the hole! Fire in the hole! Five, four, three, two, one. (explosion booms) - Oh my god. (explosion booms) Jeez. (laughs) - [Jesse] Stay down. - Oh, yeah, yeah. Okay. Gotta say that, okay, gotta clear the wrench. - All clear! - Oh my God. - [Jesse] All right, Henry. Yeah, how do you like that? - Geez, man. (explosion booms) (mysterious music) - [Jesse] Is that what you came for? - Yeah, yeah, for sure. That was insane. - Look at how it carved out the exact imprint of the bottle a foot and a half below. Okay, look, we even have puncture on the second to last hole. The smallest is not punctured. - [Henry] Yeah. Wow. - So I mean, that's the entire range of our measurement capability. - Yeah. (laughs) I'm gonna get you through through. (laughs) That's awesome. (laughs) His invention, the blasting cap, was refined to use an even more consistent explosive than gunpowder, mercury fulminate. It became the first reliable way to detonate nitroglycerin on command. The design was so effective, it remained virtually unchanged for decades. I think it'd be hard to argue that this advancement doesn't find its place into every other explosive device that comes after it basically. - Probably the most significant development since the invention of gunpowder. The same idea, using a small explosion to trigger a much larger one would later be used in atomic bombs to set off nuclear chain reactions. With the invention of the blasting cap, the use of nitroglycerin finally became practical. - It can break rock and make tunnels much more effectively. - Nitroglycerin sped up industrial excavation. In one mind, the rate of tunneling almost doubled from 0.76 to 1.34 meters per day. And in Mexico, crews reported that 15 men using nitroglycerin could do the work of 25 with gunpowder. So orders started pouring in from mining companies, engineers, and railway builders from around the world. To meet the sudden demand, Alfred began producing nitroglycerin in Sweden, enlisting the help of his younger brother, Emil. But on the 3rd of September, 1864, an intern asked Emil for help moving a heavy crate. The two began to lift when suddenly, (explosion booms) the factory was ripped apart. (dramatic music) A witness wrote this of the explosion. ""Most ghastly was the sight of the mutilated corpses strewn on the ground. Not only had their clothes been torn off, but on some, the head was missing and the flesh ripped off the bones. These formless masses of flesh and bone bore little or no resemblance to a human body."" Emil, just 21 years old and four others, the intern, a janitor, a young laborer, and a passing carpenter all died in the explosion. Alfred blamed himself and he swore, ""I will never let this happen again. I will make nitroglycerin safe."" (dramatic music) The city of Stockholm declared nitroglycerin too dangerous and banned its production within city limits. Alfred, however, refused to give up. So this is a moment where he's actually a pretty savvy entrepreneur. He says, ""Okay, if I'm not gonna do it on land, I'm gonna do it on the water."" So he set up a laboratory on a floating barge on Lake Malaren. But as he was experimenting, another one of his factories in Germany exploded. Alfred was fighting a ticking clock. With every day that passed, more lives were lost. Workers were terrified. No sane agent would use it. A mining publication reported we confidently expect within 30 days to announce another serious accident. See, he had addressed the problem of detonation, but not nitroglycerin's fundamental sensitivity. Because nitroglycerin is so viscous, tiny bubbles of air and water vapor easily get trapped inside. As we zoom in, you'll notice there are even more. These gases are a problem. When a shockwave reaches a bubble, it squeezes it, compressing the gas and heating it up. And it happens so fast that the heat can escape. And so the temperature inside can increase by thousands of degrees Celsius in an instant. It creates a hotspot. The gas molecules in these hotspots carry so much energy that they break the weak N-O bonds in the nitroglycerin molecules nearby. And so these molecules then decompose, releasing even more hot gases. But nitroglycerin doesn't just have one of these bubbles. No, it's filled with them. So that's what makes it so sensitive to shock. A single impact can collapse many bubbles at once, which releases enough energy to trigger the chain reaction that detonates the entire liquid. (explosion booms) Now, you might think to make nitroglycerin safe, Alfred just has to get rid of those bubbles, right? Well, it's not that easy. - You have an air bubble trap, it's like really hard to get that out without like starting to, you know, bang on it. And then you don't wanna do that because you don't want it to go off. - But even if you could remove every single bubble, you would still have a problem. That's because nitroglycerin is a lot like the liquid in this beer bottle. I replaced it with water. And you can see, you know, there aren't many bubbles. But if I give it a smack. (bottle shatters) Whoa! (laughs) The impact drives the bottom of the beer bottle down faster than the liquid can follow, which creates this sudden pressure drop. And that drop of vaporizes the liquid and creates bubbles. When the liquid rushes back in, those bubbles then collapse violently. And those implosions sometimes release enough energy to crack the glass. Now, a similar thing can happen in nitroglycerin. A strong impact can create new bubbles inside the liquid in a process called cavitation. And their collapse again triggers the same chain reaction. (excited music) So Alfred realized that the only way around the bubble problem was to change the state of nitroglycerin from a liquid to a solid. Working on his barge in Germany, he tried mixing in powdered charcoal, sand, wood shavings, brick dust and cement, but nothing really worked. (sullen music) Dejected, he looked down and noticed something strange, a fine powder whispering around his feet. So he looked up and saw the same pale threads drifting over the banks of the Elbe. Millions of years earlier, that dust had actually been living organisms, diatoms. Single-celled algae that once floated in ancient seas. But now, in the dunes above the river, all that remained were their fossilized exoskeletons. That made for a fine silica powder that carried on the wind. This material, diatomaceous earth or kieselguhr, had been appreciated by Darwin. He wrote, ""Few objects are more beautiful than the minute siliceous cases of the diatomaceae."" But Alfred saw beyond their beauty to the microscopic holes in their exoskeletons. - [Jesse] On the granular level, it's got lots of little pores and places to absorb the liquid into. - We're looking for what kind of consistency. - Oh, it's gonna be like a thick and solid. It will make the nitroglycerin less sensitive. So the same hammer impact that you would try with straight nitroglycerin would take more force, because that absorbent material will take some of that energy from the impact. - That kind of feels like we're baking. - Right. - [Henry] In fact, kiesleguhr can soak up more than three times its weight in liquid nitroglycerin. - And so if it's porous now, if you mix it with a nitroglycerin, the nitroglycerin can kind of go into the pores. What that helps do is separate the nitroglycerin molecules from each other. - And within any individual pore, there just isn't enough nitroglycerin to propagate the detonation. So now when it's bumped or shaken, the mixture won't detonate. And if we drop it in the exact same way that set off the nitroglycerin. Drop. It didn't go. - No. - So this new material won't explode when you drop it. So can you still detonate it? Well, if you combine it with Alfred's other invention, the blasting cap, the resulting shockwave is powerful enough to compress many pockets of nitroglycerin at the same time, which triggers the detonation. (explosion booms) (bright music) - [Jesse] The biggest explosion we've seen up to now is 100 grams of nitroglycerin. - [Henry] Yeah, it'll be the biggest one we've done so far. - [Jesse] Three, two, one. (explosion booms) (Henry laughs) - [Henry] Oh, that's so sick. - ""To all whom it may concern, be it known that I, Alfred Nobel have invented a new and useful composition of matter, to wit, an explosive powder."" (dramatic music) To name it, he took the Greek word dynamis meaning power, and he made it dynamite. (explosion booms) Alfred was determined to capitalize on his new invention, and he believed that he could make the most money in England. England is a jewel worth the rest of the world, he said. A dynamite company there would have the entire empire as its market. So in the spring of 1868, he set foot on British soil carrying with him a suitcase overflowing with dynamite. - 'Cause he is going around and he's inviting journalists to come to these demonstrations where he would bring sticks of dynamite in his backpack and a stand. He would set up these huge boulders, basically, and put a stick of dynamite in there and watch as they like cleft in two. Alfred was a clever salesman. So when Alfred created dynamite, nitroglycerin still had a terrible reputation. And so his initial thought was to name it, ""Nobel's safety powder."" - Oh. I like that. - Come on down, get you a Nobel Safety powder. Blow the hell out of this rock. You know? Whatever the name. His invention came at the perfect time. Around when Alfred introduced dynamite, there were two other major breakthroughs, the pneumatic drill and the diamond drilling crown, which now made it easy to bore holes in solid rock. Perfect for a stick of dynamite. (explosion booms) These tools revolutionized construction. Many of the iconic engineering feats of the era from the Brooklyn Bridge to the Panama Canal depended on dynamite. One thing that I think is really interesting to think about is Russia at the time isn't the Russia that we think of now. It was effectively a mid-sized European country. 'Cause they had this vast wealth of resources, but it was cut off by these mountains. And so without dynamite, you actually wouldn't have the Russia we have today 'cause you would've never been able to make the Trans Siberian Railroad. It's worth saying that dynamite is different than TNT. - Yeah, I was gonna ask about that actually. Trinitroglycerin. - Trinitrotolu, toluene. Tolu? - Trinitrotoluene. - Yup. Trinitrotoluene. - Those nitrogens are bound to carbons, not to oxygens, and so that makes it much more stable so you don't have that really weak oxygen nitrogen bond. Because of that, it is much, much, much less sensitive than nitroglycerin. - So that actually wouldn't be discovered for another couple decades after dynamite, - The TNT labels on the dynamite sticks in the Looney Tunes cartoons never bothered me when I watched them as a kid. But now I'm just like, ""Wait, that's not right. They're not TNT in there."" - But the main point is that dynamite happened first. And no matter what ACDC says, it is not TNT. - It's a good line. - Yeah, I mean, it's a good track too. So dynamite was changing the world, but the old dangers of nitroglycerin were hard to escape. (sullen music) In 1869, near Brentford, England, a barge carrying dynamite exploded on the river Thames, killing three people and damaging buildings 800 meters away. Investigators traced the cause to dynamite that had been sweating beads of nitroglycerin. See, wet kieselguhr from the riverbed has to first be dried to remove moisture. And that leaves empty pores ready to absorb nitroglycerin. But the kieselguhr never loses that strong attraction to water. So if your dynamite is later exposed to moisture, even just humidity in the air, but water seeps back into those pores, and the invading water molecules then encounter nitroglycerin, which gets pushed outwards. Now, moisture wasn't the only culprit. Time and temperature could also cause this separation. But moisture just made the problem a lot worse, though it actually wasn't Alfred's only concern. See, kieselguhr is inert, and since dynamite was about 25% kieselguhr, that meant it would always absorb a large fraction of the explosive energy, and that power was wasted. It reduced the strength of Alfred's explosive, and ultimately, it hurt his bottom line. So he kept experimenting with new formulations and new absorbents. Again and again, he failed. But he was undeterred saying, ""If I have 1,000 ideas and only one turns out to be good, I am satisfied."" Then one day, while working in his home lab in Paris, he cut his hand. It was a pretty deep cut, and blood started to pour out. So he grabbed a bandage, pressed it to the wound, and watched it soak up the mess. That night, the pain woke him. But as he was lying there in the dark, annoyed at his earlier carelessness, his mind drifted back to the bandage, how clean it was, how fast it absorbed the blood. He bolted upright and rushed down to the lab. He thought, ""If cotton is so good at absorbing blood, maybe it'll be just as good at absorbing nitroglycerin."" So inside that bandage is this, and it looks like regular cotton, but you'll see it's not when I light it up. Woo! - Yeah, I remember, yeah, watching this YouTube video where they just light it on fire and the whole thing's just gone. And it is so counterintuitive and so just crazy to see. It's like magic. I'm sure it's used in like magic shows too. - Woo! It's called gun cotton or nitrocellulose. And nitrocellulose is made by taking cellulose polymers, say from cotton or wood pulp. And then replacing the oh, groups with oxygen atoms bonded to nitro groups, which are the same unstable groups that made nitroglycerin so explosive. So now when you ignite it, these groups rapidly break down into products like nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and water. All of which are gases, so there's no particulate to scatter light. That's why the whole thing seems to just disappear into thin air. But what Alfred was interested in was what happened when you combined it with nitroglycerin? See, nitrocellulose has these chains that are very similar to nitroglycerin chemically because of the nitro groups. So because of that, they mix easily. - Now you have two things that are soluble. They like each other. This is very different from, you know, kieselguhr, water and nitroglycerin. - And now when you mix them, the smaller nitroglycerin molecules slip between these long nitrocellulose chains, trapping the nitroglycerin molecules and keeping them apart. Just like in the dynamite. If you mix in just a small amount of nitrocellulose, you get a stable moldable gel that resists sweating. We're take a little bit of the nitrocellulose, a gun cotton like this much. - Yeah. - Okay, we're gonna start with a little bit. We're gonna drop it in there. You see that it soaks right in. - [Jesse] Yeah, yeah. - Keep on adding bits until it soaks all up and then we'll stir it around to make sure there's no dry spots. But that's not all. This mixture also solves Alfred's problem of yield. The matrix, like the structure that it's being held in is itself explosive. So now you get perfect yield, no sweating, ding, bang, boom. And because the material is a gel, it can be molded into different shapes, perfect for precise controlled mining blasts. - [Jesse] While it's soft like this, we can put it into a shape, and then when it sets, it'll stay that shape. - We enough to do a VE? - Oh yeah, yeah. Let's make a VE. (explosion booms) (mysterious music) - Alfred named it Gelignite. The world's first moldable explosive. With gelignite, dynamite, and the blasting cap in hand, Alfred had fulfilled his oath. He had made explosives safer everyone. He opened factories across the world, in Scotland, France, the United States and beyond. By the early 1870s, he was running more than 90 sites in 20 countries. But not everyone was happy. His father never recovered from Emil's death and just weeks after the explosion in Stockholm, Immanuel suffered a stroke. He survived, but was never the same. Immanuel became obsessed with death, often rambling to Alfred about strange inventions, including a scheme to build a network of underground tubes that would carry corpses directly from people's homes to giant incinerators. - His dad never had the success that Alfred's having, you know, financially, and he's being lauded as this great inventor. His dad, I think, is just jealous essentially. But he claims that Alfred had stolen the idea for dynamite from him. - So he says to his dad, ""Rather than regarding this idea as your own, far from it, you laughed at it. Your fatherly love seems to run aground on complacency or vanity. It should not seem strange that I, at the age of 30, will not allow myself to be treated as a schoolboy. It pains me but when it comes to serious matters, I've adopted the rule of acting seriously. Despite the confident front he put up for his father, the truth was that his wealth hadn't made him any happier. He says, ""I'm two steps ahead of my competitors, but the accumulation of money and praise leaves me totally indifferent. My home is where I work, and I work everywhere. I am a nomadic atom with no attachments, no roots, and no real joy in life. By 1876, he couldn't take it anymore. Overwhelmed by the loneliness, he placed an ad. Wealthy, highly educated, elderly gentleman seeks lady of mature age, versed in languages as secretary and supervisor of household. And into his life, entered Bertha Kinsky. She was an idealistic woman, part of the ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
udding Peace Movement. Together, they took long carriage rides where they discussed the role of science and society and whether it could serve a purpose greater than war. For a moment, Alfred was happy. Hopeful, he asked if her heart was free. But while Alfred was away on business, she left to be with another man in Austria. So Alfred was back to being alone. Alfred was heartbroken. He responded by throwing himself even deeper into his work. Alfred attempted to sell his explosives to the French military, but they weren't interested. Then a year later, when war broke out between France and Prussia, German troops hurled dynamite at the French positions. Now, Alfred received a message. The French wanted to place an order. - One thing that I think is important to like think about in this moment is that people have been stabbed, bruised, shot with gunpowder and all this other stuff, but up till then, it would've been totally foreign to see that level of destruction on a human body. - Yeah, it would've been unmatched in kind of human history. - As he starts thinking more about war and becoming involved with like the French military, the German military, the Italian military. They come to him with a problem that's been plaguing them for hundreds of years since the invention of gunpowder, which is that on a battlefield with black powder. When you shoot, it obscures visibility so you don't really know how to shoot again. Like, you can't aim very well. Yeah, one thing you're seeing with the black powder is that every time it explodes, there's just this huge plume of smoke that enemy fighters would be able to see your location. So it's just this big problem where there's like a literal fog of war. Alfred starts contemplating that problem. What he thinks back to is gun cotton. You know, it doesn't create smoke. Can I use gun cotton to replace powder? But the problem with using gun cotton or any high explosive mass in small arms is that it detonates all at once, releasing its energy in a split second, and the pressure inside the barrel spikes faster than the bullet can accelerate. So much of the energy is wasted as heat. Instead of propelling the projectile, it can even destroy the barrel. What Alfred wanted was a propellant that built pressure gradually, so the forest rose smoothly as the bullet traveled down the barrel. So he began experimenting with a new nitroglycerin nitrocellulose mixture. By adding 10 to 20 times more nitrocellulose than a gelignite, he transformed it from a jelly into a tougher substance, one that could be rolled into pasta thin sheets in Italy. They even used pasta makers to do this. These sheets were then stamped into countless tiny little grains. When these grains were packed into a cartridge, they wouldn't fit tightly. Small gaps of air remained between them, but that was actually a good thing. Now, when one grain ignited, a shockwave couldn't just race through the entire charge at once. Instead, each grain had to ignite its neighbor. And the one beside it, and the next one in sequence. This slowed down the burn rate and allowed the pressure to build gradually. So they were able to replicate the effect of gunpowder. And because the fuel was a combination of nitroglycerin and nitrocellulose, both of which broke down into clear, stable gases, it burned with little smoke. So Alfred had solved a problem that had plagued armies for centuries, - And to this day, the propellant in much of the world's ammunition is still a combination of nitroglycerin and nitrocellulose. Just like Alfred's invention, he called it ballistite, the world's first smokeless high energy propellant. Alfred quickly received an order for 300,000 kilograms of ballistite from the Italian army. So he opened a massive armaments factory in Italy and began to fall deeper into the world of warfare. He developed landmines, early gun silencers, and even experimented with one of the first rocket-powered missiles. It flew over four kilometers down range, and allegedly captured this image. - The whole time, he's in contact with Bertha, like the woman who kind of jilted him," and she's become pretty important in the peace movement at the time. She wrote this book called """"Lay Down Your Arms."""" That became kind of a sensation and established these peace congresses across the world. To her", he insisted," """"My rockets are meant not only for war"," but also for the rescue of shipwrecked persons."""" He even took it a step further. """"Perhaps my factories will put an end to war sooner than your congresses. On the day that two army corps can mutually annihilate each other in a second. All civilized nations will surely recoil with horror and disband their troops."""" This is a concept that we see a lot of. When people are sure to kill each other with the modern weapons that I've given them", no war will be possible. It's also the same thing that we think about in Oppenheimer. - I feel like we've heard it so many times that you just can't believe it ever. - No. - And then it's just marketing on the part of all these guys who are selling weapons. They don't wanna come across as evil guys who are like," """"I'm gonna make something that'll help you kill more people than ever before."""" I mean", that's kind of the truth of it, - Especially in the dynamite case. It feels like a tremendous misjudgment of human nature. It's like, yeah. - Yeah. - This is not gonna be used for to stop war. And we definitely don't see that in the decades that follow. (jazz music) Between the 1890s and the 1920s, over 7,000 bombings occurred in New York alone. Imagine waking up, opening the paper and seeing another explosion every other day for decades. (sullen music) The most common perpetrators were known as the Dynamite Club. They were part of a deadly new political movement on the rise in America. They rejected industrialization and longed for a simpler world. Today, their name evokes chaos and destruction. But at the time, it was more literal. No ruler, an-ackhos. This was anarchy. They were so crazy and so effective using dynamite that Theodore Roosevelt addressed Congress, and he said," """"The largest threat facing the US is the anarchist threat."""" - Were they intentionally just killing people? - Yeah. Their argument was that", you know, if if one person dies at the hands of an anarchist, 100 people have died in the industrial machine. Yeah. - These people sound crazy. In fact, the entire modern practice of terrorism using spectacular violence to advance a political agenda, often targeting civilians, but that all began with the anarchists and their dynamite. Dynamite unlocked a new scale of destruction previously unimaginable. With only a few sticks in a coat pocket, one person could walk into a crowded street and wreak havoc. What began as an industrial tool had become a weapon of mass murder. In 1927 in Bath, Michigan, a man spent months wiring the town's new elementary school with dynamite. He hid the charges in the basement and crawl spaces, concealed them under floors and behind walls, all while serving as the school board treasurer. Then on the morning of May 18th, just after classes began, he triggered the explosives. As parents and rescuers rushed to the scene, he arrived in a truck packed with more dynamite and shrapnel and detonated. In all, 38 children, six adults, and the attacker died. Another 58 were grievously injured. The deadliest school massacre in American history was not a shooting. It was a dynamite attack. Of course, Alfred couldn't know all the ways in which his inventions would be abused, but he had seen the destruction in his own life, and he had heard the pleas to change his ways. So in 1888, when he read that paper, something in him broke. (somber music) Just a few years later, as his health began to fail, as he took pellets of nitroglycerin to ease the pain in his chest, he couldn't shake the thought. So he called his lawyer and wrote a new will. With 94% of his personal fortune, 31.2 million Swedish kronor or about $340 million today, he created a set of prizes for those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind, the Nobel Prize. There were five in total. For chemistry, physics, medicine, literature, and finally, peace. (gentle music) On December 10th,1896, Alfred Nobel died in his villa in Italy. Just as he had always feared, he died alone. At the time of his death, he held 355 patents and ran an empire of 90 factories that produced explosives and armaments across the world. And yet, in his final act, he gave his fortune away for an idea. So did it work? Did it redeem him in the eyes of everyone today? - Have you ever heard the name Alfred Nobel? - Oh yeah. He was the creator of the Nobel Peace Prize. - Nobel Prize. - Nobel Prize. - Nobel Prize. - Nobel Prize. - Nobel Prize. - Nobel Prize. - Nobel Prize. - Nobel Prize. - Nobel Prize. - Anything else? - I should know more. - The Nobel Prize. - Is that it? - Yes. - I'm saying like nothing like dynamite. Don't think about that at all? - Dynamite? - Yeah. He also invented dynamite. - Did not know that. - I didn't know about the dynamite. I knew about the Peace Prize, but that's it. - I think the attempt has been to have him portrayed as somebody who tried to promote new understanding and advances in science. And so that's- - That's his legacy. - Yeah. - Yeah. - It would seem. - I mean, if you're cynical, you say it's a PR move. And are you inclined to be cynical? - I think it must be at least somewhat a PR move. To me, like Nobel Prize has always been like the pinnacle of achievement. If anyone wins the Nobel Prizes, like, yeah, you're done. Like that's all you need to accomplish in life. I mean, in some ways, like maybe he was in control of his legacy. - Yes, and he took control of his legacy. - He did. - He decided he wanted it to be a positive thing. There's a twisted irony to the story. When Alfred Nobel created dynamite, he was trying to make explosive safer to prevent the kind of accident that killed his brother. But by making nitroglycerin easier to handle, he also made it more accessible and that made it more deadly. So why then did he create the Nobel Prizes? Was it out of the goodness of his heart? Or a desire to redeem himself in the eyes of everyone who would come after? I mean, I think the idea that anyone anywhere can be recognised for advancing science, literature or peace is beautiful. - 'This award is not just a piece of metal that you would wear an award that you would keep in your room but, this is really an encouragement for me to go forward and to believe in myself. To know that there are people who are supporting me in this campaign.' So maybe it doesn't matter why he did it," only that he did.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tZ8ehplVFp4,The Most Dangerous Escalator in Rome,,Educational,"- On October 23rd, 2018, thousands of football fans were making their way to the game in Rome. Excitement for the game was high, and the fans began to chant and sing. At 7:03 pm, around 50 people were riding the long escalator down to the platform, but within 30 seconds, the crowd had swelled to nearly double that. Everything seemed fine, but inside the escalator was a problem. The weight of the passengers was bearing down on the steps, and the load on the main motor was increasing. To try to slow the descent, the motor applied a counter torque. But as the force continued to increase, the stairs began to move faster. By 7:04 pm, the crowd had tripled. The motor finally reached its limit, and under the massive strain, the drum began to slip. With the motor losing control, the escalator triggered its second line of defense. A safety relay tripped, immediately cutting power to the motor. The main brake clamped down on the metal drum to stop the descent of the stairs, but, it failed. The friction on the main drum wasn't enough to stop the motor from spinning, and the stairs continued to accelerate. Sensing the motor had lost control of the steps, the escalator engaged the last line of defense. In the event of an emergency, an auxiliary break is designed to bypass the motor entirely and directly lock the drive shaft. Under normal circumstances, the chance that all three safety measures fail at the same time is vanishingly small. But these weren't normal circumstances. At 7:05 pm, the third and final safety system failed, and the stairs began to plummet. Fans were flung forward and started streaming down the escalator. Some lept over the central barrier in desperation, while others were swept into a crushing pileup. At the bottom, the landing became a dangerous choke point. Under the pressure, the steps twisted and buckled into jagged metal, leaving 24 people injured. Something like this shouldn't have been possible, and experts at the time knew that something had gone wrong, and they started to suspect foul play. In the aftermath, Rome's Transit Agency sealed off the accident site and closed the Republica station for several months. The authorities ordered both a technical and a criminal investigation, and the mayor even publicly vowed to discover the cause of the accident. So investigators began dismantling the wreck, tearing it down piece by piece to reconstruct what had happened. The ride people experienced on that escalator was one of the most terrifying rides of their lives. But maybe it's more similar to the origin of escalators than you might think. Like what was the first escalator even used for? Do you wanna have a guess? It was an attraction in a theme park all the way back in 1896. It had no steps, a 25 degree incline, and it was essentially just a slow conveyor belt made of metal and wooden parts. It brought people up a full seven feet before they would have to walk downstairs on the other side, and it was a huge success. Over 75,000 people enjoyed the attraction during its two week stay at the Old Iron Pier on Coney Island. The ride was named the Continuous Elevator and its inventor, Jesse Reno, had created it not just as an attraction, but as a proof of concept, because he saw it as the future of transportation. But as Reno watched people ride his invention, he began to notice a pattern. Nobody walked. Instead, they stood still, feet planted firmly sideways with people gripping the handrail tightly. Two years later, the department store Harrods in England installed a similar device, but the ride was so unsettling that Harrods had to put staff at the top to offer brandy to men and smelling salts to women just to calm their nerves. You see, for both devices, the 25 degree conveyor belt was precarious to walk on and unnerving to stand on. At around 12 degrees, walking on an incline becomes difficult, and 25 degrees is roughly the limit that our ankles can flex. If only there was a way to replace the conveyor belt with a moving set of stairs. Well, then the riders would always have a flat surface to stand on and a staircase they could climb if they wanted to. One attempt at a solution had already been around for four decades, and it was called the revolving stairs. It consisted of a chain that went around a loop, then fixed stair shaped blocks were attached to it, creating a flat surface to stand on during the main incline. But as soon as you'd reached the top, the steps tilted forward, making it treacherous to get off, and a similar problem plagued you at the bottom. Now, you might think if the top and bottom are causing problems, just extend each landing, but that also doesn't work. You just end up with a jagged mess for longer. So how do modern escalators solve this problem? I mean, have you ever stopped to think what happens to the stairs at the top of the escalator when they disappear? Clearly, we have steps going around in some sort of loop, but how do they actually behave on the return journey? What if I give you two options? Do they stay right side up like the cabins in a Ferris wheel, or do they flip upside down and then flip back again at the other side? - I'm gonna go this one all day. - Ferris wheel. - This one makes more sense. - Ferris Wheel. - Yeah, this one. - I think they turn upside down. - And they're actually right side up. - I think I'm gonna go with this. - Wow. You're both - They just keep- - Yeah. - The solution to this problem came from another inventor named George Wheeler. His idea forms the basis of every escalator in use today. A modern version of it works something like this. A typical subway escalator has an electric motor at the top with a power output of around 50 kilowatts. Smaller than most electric cars. This motor spins extremely fast at over a 1,000 RPM, but it's pretty weak. So to drive the steps, the escalator needs to convert this into a slower output with more force. To do this, it uses a reduction gearbox in a gear system, lowering the output to just a few RPM and increasing the torque by a factor of around 100. The motor is connected with a large sprocket to a reinforced steel chain, which pulls the stairs around a loop. The so-called step chain is fitted with wheels to allow it to roll smoothly around curves. But unlike the design for the revolving stairs, Wheeler proposed attaching each step to this chain through a single axle, giving it the freedom to rotate. Next, he added a second set of wheels to each step that followed a different track, allowing him to control the angle of each step at any point. On the incline, the two tracks overlap just like the revolving staircase, but then at the top, the two tracks separate, and this is what allows us to keep the steps level throughout the entire ride. The tracks then remain separated and curve around. The steps flip upside down, tuck into the loop, and start their return journey. At the start of the incline, the tracks rejoin and the whole process repeats. - So the answer is, you are both wrong. - Oh my God. - I don't want to be interviewed anymore. - Yeah. - Wow. I never really thought about that. - Yeah, like, I would say, it's like a upside down elevator, bro. - Guess what? You're right. - Yeah? - Yeah. - But despite all modern escalators adopting Wheeler's design, at the time, it caught so little attention that he was forced to shelve the idea. It wasn't until eight years later that another inventor, Charles Seeberger, bought his patent and capitalized on the invention. Seeberger partnered with the Otis Elevator Company, and together they built a prototype. A year later, in 1900, they showcased it at the Paris Exposition Universelle. In total, 51 million people flocked to the exposition to see the marvels of modern technology. But one of the most popular exhibitions was the world's first true commercial escalator. The machine drew huge crowds. French historian Philippe Jullian described it as the jolliest attraction at the exhibition and wrote, ""The escalator caused many an incident worthy ""of the vaudeville, separating families, ""sending old men sprawling, delighting the children, ""and reducing their nannies to despair."" The escalator was even awarded one of the grand prizes of the fair. Shortly after, escalators started being installed in different places across the world. But these escalators weren't perfect. They had smooth flat stairs, and when they reached the top, these stairs would disappear under a wooden board, leaving a dangerous gap between them. Shoe laces, coats, and especially the long skirts in fashion at the time easily got caught in the machinery. One incident even saw a three year girl getting her foot pinched in the gap. And while the girl luckily escaped with injured toes and a missing shoe, something in the design had to change. To solve this, Seeberger and Otis installed a triangular shunt at the end of the escalator, forcing rider to go off to the left before they reached the dangerous gap. This system worked, but it was awkward because it meant people had to put one foot onto solid ground while the other was still moving, which became especially tricky when some people stood still and others walked. So to reduce the risk of people getting in each other's way, operators asked people to stand on the right and keep the left lane clear for faster walkers. It's a convention we still often follow to this day, but as it turns out, there's a much better solution than the shunt. Modern escalator steps aren't smooth, they're grooved. These grooves then interlock perfectly with a comb plate at the top of the escalator. So now, if a small item approaches the end, the comb plate lifts it up and out of harm's way. This makes it much harder for things to get stuck, and perhaps more importantly, it allows people to safely step off forwards. But the comb plate doesn't entirely solve the problem. We still have these gaps on the side of the escalator that can pinch and trap objects as the steps move. So to address this, a new safety feature called the skirt brush was added to the escalator in 1982. Escalators are full of subtle safety features like this, some old and some new, but almost all of them are designed around people. All the way back in 1896, Jesse Reno predicted that riders on his attraction would need something to hold onto, so he introduced a moving handrail. In a modern escalator, the motor has a separate connection to turn a friction wheel that drives the handrail. The only problem is that friction wears things down. So over time, the wheel gets smaller, and as its circumference decreases, each rotation moves the rubber loop a slightly shorter distance, so the handrail begins to move more slowly. The effect is small, but it builds up over time. So to compensate for this, a new handrail is calibrated to move around 2% faster than the steps. You can actually try this yourself. Next time you're standing on an escalator, just place your hand next to you as you stand still, and you will watch as your hand slowly drifts forward. This speed difference stops the handrail from lagging too far behind the steps over time. - Because I have definitely noticed that, that sometimes I'm on an escalator and then it's going faster than me. My hand is going faster than my body, but that means it's a new escalator. - Well, it's a new frictional wheel. That wheel that drives the hand, we don't replace, we don't replace the entire escalator. - Oh, wow, so that's like a party trick I can use to entertain my friends. I mean, I don't know when I'd have a party on an escalator, but whatever, if I'm on an escalator with my friends and I can see it moving, I'd be like, ""Hey, that's 'cause there's a new frictional wheel."" I can tell them that and impress them. - But it's not just the handrail. The speed of the steps themselves is also something that needs to be carefully controlled. And modern escalators use AC induction motors, which are extremely good at regulating their rotational speed. And this has an unexpected benefit on downward escalators. With enough people riding, their weight is enough that the motor no longer has to power the ride. Instead, the weight of the passengers themselves drives the chain and causes the motor to spin. As more people board, the force on the motor increases, and it's pushed to turn faster. But modern AC induction motors work by creating a rotating magnetic field. When the motor tries to spin faster than the field, electric currents are induced inside it, which then create their own magnetic field. This new field pushes back in the opposite direction to the spin, creating a braking force, which resists the increase in speed. But something interesting happens when the motor resists like this, rather than consuming energy, the physics of the motor flips and it uses the excess mechanical energy to produce an electric current. This is called regenerative braking, and it's the same trick that electric vehicles use to recharge their batteries. In effect, the motor turns into a generator. The result is that on a busy day, many modern downward escalators aren't just moving people, they're actually generating electricity. Often this is channeled back to the building's internal grid and used to power other devices, including the upward escalators. - So even the escalator that was invented by George Wheeler and was installed in 1920, the Paris Exhibition, et cetera, I mean, all these escalators were regenerators. - What? - Yeah, when there were people standing on the escalator in down direction, these escalators were feeding energy back into the grid. - No, it's like the down escalator's a generator? - This regenerative braking makes escalators extremely power efficient, but more importantly, it makes them inherently safe. But there is a point where if you keep adding weight, then eventually the force becomes so strong that the motor can no longer resist it. And if left unchecked, it would start accelerating uncontrollably. The stairs would go plummeting down, which is exactly what happened in Rome. After a nearly two year long investigation, the investigators published this 86 page report. Inside it lists the exact sequence of events that led to the disaster. As fans crowded onto the escalator, their combined weight increased the load on the main motor. The motor tried to resist this change, but as more and more people funneled on, the force got too high, and eventually it hit a tipping point and the motor started accelerating uncontrollably. Safety sensors in the machine noticed this sudden change and triggered two things in short succession. At first, the power to the motor was cut, and immediately after that, the main brake engaged. Two massive arms clamped down on the drum to lock it in place and avert a runaway. This break should have had enough stopping power to bring the fully loaded escalator to a halt, even under the massive strain, but it didn't. Tests after the incident showed that its braking force was far too low, around 37% of the manufacturer's specification. The weakened brake struggled to slow the spinning motor and the escalators downhill acceleration continued. This is when the last line of defense kicked in. When the escalator speed rose by more than 20%, the auxiliary brake triggered driving steel wedges into a disc on the drive shaft. But when investigators opened up this brake, they were shocked. The final mechanical backstop had been partially disabled. Someone had physically tied plastic straps around one of the two brake wedges and rendered it useless. (dramatic music) With half the system unable to engage, its stopping power was cut by 50%, just enough for the weight of all those passengers to overpower the brake and render the last line of defense useless. Investigators knew that these failures should have been automatically recorded in the error logs, but when they went to check, they found nothing. The error codes had been turned off. Meaning critical malfunctions could occur without leaving a trace. The only way this could happen was if they had been disabled on purpose, meaning someone must have reprogrammed the system to stop recording fault codes. Next investigators turn to the maintenance records, but they found these similarly incomplete and evidence of major work on the escalator was nowhere to be found at all. With all the main safety systems compromised and critical alerts turned off, the escalator had been a ticking time bomb. All findings from the technical investigation pointed not to a manufacturing defect, but to a pattern of neglect and falsification by those in charge of keeping the machine safe. This left the prosecution with one clear question, who was responsible? The trail of evidence led back to June, 2017 when maintenance responsibilities for Rome's escalators shifted to a new contractor, Metro Roma. The Transit Authority ATAC severed its contract with Metro Roma in an attempt to wash its hands of the situation. But as the criminal inquest continued, it became clear that the problem went far deeper. The investigators discovered that Metro Roma had been working hand in hand with the Transit Authority ATAC, and together they presided over negligent maintenance and falsified records all across the network. By September 2019, 11 suspects were named and the courts had suspended three ATAC managers along with the chief of Metro Roma. The prosecution's findings were grave. In many cases, safety devices had been deliberately sabotaged to avoid escalator shutdowns, and those in charge had covered their tracks through a pattern of fraud and obstruction. In the midst of the public outrage, prosecutors recorded a chilling wiretap of ATAC Manager Renato Domico. The translation, ""If you run the numbers, ""out of 700 escalators, there'd be like three ""or four more dropping. Come on."" The prosecutors note in their report that Domico appeared uninterested in the possibility there might have been people on those three or four escalators. It was simply a matter of numbers and percentages to him. It was a callous remark and it painted a clear picture of the incident. This wasn't an engineering failure, it was a human one. But that brings us to a more fundamental question. I mean, how safe are escalators really? The truth is when they're properly maintained, the safety margins on escalators are enormous. Each system is engineered to handle forces far beyond what they'll ever see in service. - So the breaking load of our step is like greater 15 kilonewtons to 1.5 tons. So you can put an elephant on the step and it won't break. Well, I've never seen a step break in my work career. Never seen a step chain break either. I mean, it's does not happen. I mean, I'm not here to say that there are no accidents on an escalator, but the accidents I know, I mean, it's critical like that you, that you ensure the right maintenance. That's the most important thing, because in the end, it's all about maintenance. - When this is done right, the chances of a catastrophic failure are vanishingly small and with around 1.5 million escalators worldwide, that really is how it should be. In the US and Canada alone, over a hundred billion escalator trips are happening every year, making the escalator one of the most widely used forms of transport on the planet. On a scale that large, it's sometimes easy to point the finger at our technology when things go wrong. But the truth is, no matter how well designed our systems are, they all rely on people to maintain them. And perhaps that's the lesson here. As humans, we have a duty of care, not just to ourselves, but to everyone around us. And sometimes that means taking responsibility for keeping each other safe. (gentle music) In a way, that's how the escalators story began with one person deciding to take responsibility for a problem that everyone else ignored. Back when Jesse Reno was at university, every day, he had to climb more than 300 steps to get to his frat house. But while everyone else complained about this, Reno did something about it. He had the math, the science, and most importantly, the problem solving skills to create the world's very first escalator, which he took to Coney Island.

CxVXvFOPIyQ,Exposing Why Farmers Can't Legally Replant Their Own Seeds,,Educational,"One October evening in 2016, an Arkansas farmer was sitting in his  pickup truck just outside his field, and he was growing impatient. Suddenly, another car pulled up  beside him, so the farmer got out. Seconds later, he was murdered. The farmer's name was Mike Wallace. He wasn't killed over money or land. He was killed over a herbicide, a  chemical designed to destroy weeds. This herbicide spread fear through rural  America, turning farmers against each other, all because it belonged to a certain company. This company's policies, they pitted farmer against farmer, and they could just send henchman to your door. Even if you just had the  wrong seeds in your field, they could send you to court and bankrupt you. In effect, they had a farmland monopoly. They owned more than 80% of the  seeds planted in the United States. And to get this monopoly,  they played the legal system- Colluding with corrupted EPA officials. twisted scientific evidence. Now appears to have been caught red-handed. But the chemicals they were making destroyed the health of  communities all over the world. This is a video about Monsanto, one of the biggest agricultural  companies in the world. Our investigation is based on  publicly available documents, recordings and third-party opinions. All sources are linked in the description. In 1942, a chemist named Franklin D. Jones made an unusual enemy: poison ivy. See, his children had a very  violent reaction to the plant. They would get intense rashes and swelling  when they brushed up against the ivy,   so Jones wanted a way to kill it. He experimented by spraying the ivy with hormones, chemicals that could regulate the plant's   functions the same way they  do in humans and animals. His hope was that one of these  hormones would cause it to die. Unfortunately, many had no effect and  others only made the ivy grow better. But then, one day, Jones noticed  that certain samples began to show   autumn colors, much sooner than they should have. He watched as the vibrant  hues turned to twisted shapes, and then within days, these  plants shriveled up and died. Jones checked the chemical he  sprayed them with, and surprisingly, it was a growth hormone called 2,4-D. It's an acid made up of a ring of six carbons and   hydrogens called a benzene  ring, with an acid tail. There are also two chlorine atoms in  the two and four positions of the ring,   which is why it's called 2,4-D. To keep things tidy, we don't have to  draw all these carbons and hydrogens,   but keep in mind they're still there. Jones realized this synthetic  hormone was incredibly potent. Tiny amounts of it would still  encourage the ivy to grow, but if he sprayed on a lot  of it, 2,4-D would trigger   such uncontrollable and unsustainable growth that the poison ivy would die in the process. So effectively, he had plant cancer in a bottle. I was just going to say plant cancer. Right? That's immediately where my brain went. What was even more remarkable was  that it only targeted the ivy. The grass around it was barely affected,  like it was resistant to 2,4-D. So over the next two years, Jones performed  over a hundred different experiments by pouring the herbicide onto  many different plant species. And what he figured out was  that 2,4-D was really picky. It killed broad-leaved weeds like  dandelions, chickweed, and poison ivy, but it virtually ignored crops. Wheat, corn, and barley were all mostly   unaffected by 2,4-D because all  of these are species of grass. To improve this pickiness further, Jones  also tested chemicals similar to 2,4-D. He found that adding another  chlorine to the benzene ring, transforming it to 2,4,5-T, left  grasses even more unscathed. He was onto something huge. Because up until then, farmers could  get rid of weeds one of two ways. Either you spray them with  dangerous chemicals like arsenic or you have to pull the weeds out manually. Either way, you're at a loss. But with 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T, you could spray your  entire crop field, and only the weeds would die. Jones had stumbled upon the first  practically viable selective herbicides, so he was quick to patent them in  1945, just as the war was ending. After the Allies victory, the patent secrecy  restrictions in most countries were lifted, and it turned out that there were other  scientists, both in the US but also in the UK,   who discovered these herbicides independently. Soon, the world was blessed with  modern miracle weed killers,   like Weedone and Weed-A-Bomb and Endo-Weed, all formulations of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T herbicides. This man is ready to kill weeds, because  he's going to do it the easy way. These chemicals literally replaced the hoe,   and everything from farm fields  to railroad tracks and sidewalks. They're essentially what gave us that beautiful  green American lawn, just grass and nothing else. Because with these herbicides, dad knew there  was no longer any excuse for a weedy lawn. By the late 1940s, their herbicide business  had turned into a roughly $10 million industry, and everyone wanted in, including one of  the biggest chemical companies at the time: Monsanto. One of Monsanto's main herbicide  factories was in Nitro, West Virginia, where they pumped out almost  a ton of 2,4,5-T a day. By 1949, Monsanto's business was  booming, when all of a sudden... the plant exploded. Over a hundred workers rushed out to see a  dark cloud rising 40 meters above the factory. They watched as a black stinking powder  started raining down on their faces. Within hours, many of these men fell ill. First, they got headaches and nausea,   but then their skin began to erupt  with bumps, pustules, and acne. The lesions on some of the workers'  faces got so bad that Monsanto's   on-site doctors had to peel off layers of  their skin in an attempt to remove them. The doctors later noted that when these men are  in a closed room together, there is a strong odor. They wrote, ""We believe these men are excreting  a foreign chemical through their skins."" But neither the doctors nor anyone else  at Monsanto knew what the chemical was because both 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D  were marketed as very safe. See, when the herbicides were first getting  introduced, Jones, the original inventor, even remarked that he knew people  who would accidentally drink or   spray the herbicides onto themselves,  and they suffered no ill health effects. They were fine. And one of the doctors after him remarked that: ""I've personally taken one half a gram  of pure 2,4-D a day for three weeks. You judge the results."" It was the '40s, so people were a bit crazy. But yeah, it seemed pretty safe. Back at Nitro, Monsanto analyzed all the other  ingredients they were using to make 2,4,5-T, but they still couldn't find what was causing  their workers' skin to erupt in this way. This is where their search seemingly stopped. With no culprit, the conditions at  the plant stayed mostly the same,   and Monsanto just offered their workers a choice: either you'll keep on working with 2,4,5-T or you can take the gate. For many, this was no choice at all since  there were hardly any other jobs in town. So, most of the workers stayed  with something inside the factory,   poisoning them for years to come. It wasn't until 1957, 8 years after the explosion, that a German dermatologist, Karl Schulz,   found himself treating patients with  similar-looking lesions and acne. He wasn't surprised by the symptoms because   many of these patients worked in  2,4,5-T factories around Hamburg. But when Schulz would test these  ingredients from the instruction   list on rabbit ears he had at the  lab, he would get no reactions. And this puzzled him. How do these ingredients do  nothing in his own tests, but at the same time cause these painful  skin disorders inside 2,4,5-T factories? Well, to make 2,4,5-T, you  start with tetrachlorobenzene,   a benzene ring with four  chlorine atoms attached to it. These chlorine atoms are very electronegative, so  they want to steal electrons from nearby atoms. Luckily for them, the six  carbons in the benzene ring   are all sharing their electrons in these  fuzzy donut-shaped clouds around the ring. That's what this circle in the  diagram is meant to represent. The chlorine atoms pull on this electron cloud,  bringing it closer to themselves, and as a result, the carbons in the benzene ring  become slightly positively charged   and the chlorine's slightly negatively charged. Now, if you heat up tetrachlorobenzene  with sodium hydroxide, one of the negative hydroxide ions will want to   bind to one of the slightly positively  charged carbons in the benzene ring. And to do that, it forces out the  chlorine atom, taking its place. This creates trichlorophenol, or TCP, a  key ingredient in making the herbicide. From here, if you keep the  reaction at 170 degrees Celsius, you can add a series of chemicals to grow out  this oxygen tail into an acid, giving you 2,4,5-T. On paper, this is all there is. If you follow the exact steps here and control  the conditions, then none of these ingredients   will explain the horrible face eruptions  that the Nitro workers were experiencing. But Schulz wasn't satisfied with this. Maybe the conditions aren't perfect. Maybe there is something in this  process, some secret reaction   that is contaminating the whole chemical supply. Ideally, the industrial process  of transforming tetrachlorobenzene   into 2,4,5-T should happen at 170 degrees Celsius. But if the temperature gets any  higher, even just a few degrees higher,   there is suddenly enough energy in the system  for two molecules of TCP to fuse together. This creates a molecule commonly known as dioxin. It forms only in trace amounts, so you  might expect to end up with roughly one   or two molecules of dioxin for every  hundred thousand molecules of 2,4,5-T. It seemed too small to be a problem. Nevertheless, Schulz decided to test it. He took some TCP, this time contaminated with   trace amounts of dioxin, and  rubbed it into his own skin, and he got the same acne as  the workers at the Nitro plant. Once Schulz realized the threat here,   he immediately contacted all the  big chemical producers in Germany, and one of these German companies even  sent letters to both Monsanto and Dow,   the other big herbicide producer in the US, and they warned them that the acne-causing effects   are stemming from pollution through  byproducts, referring to dioxin. They even listed when exactly during the process   the contamination was happening  and what to do to prevent it. Yet, Monsanto denied ever getting these letters,  and Dow said they somehow misfiled them. Regardless, it was obvious to  both companies that something   in the production of 2,4,5-T  was poisoning their workers. But Monsanto didn't warn  the public about the danger, perhaps because the herbicides were  about to make them a whole lot of money. In 1961, the president of South Vietnam was  at war with the newly founded Viet Cong. This guerrilla force was set on overthrowing his  rule and uniting Vietnam under a communist regime. The Viet Cong were masters of the jungle. They laid deadly traps for their enemies  and ambushed them using underground tunnels. South Vietnam was losing the war,  so the president faced a choice:   either accept defeat in the jungle or destroy it. He reached out to his allies,  the US, and asked them for help. Soon, they came in flying with  thousands of barrels of herbicide. This was the start of Operation Ranch Hand. The US's herbicide of choice was Agent Orange, a 50/50 split of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T supplied  by the US's biggest chemical manufacturers. The largest supplier by volume was Monsanto. Agent Orange ravaged through South  Vietnam destroying 20% of the jungles. And civilians and soldiers on both sides  got sprayed with it too, mostly by accident. The government assured them  that it is not toxic to humans,   animals, or drinking water, but  Monsanto and Dow knew otherwise. See during Ranch Hand, they secretly  exchanged information on their herbicides. And in one of the letters,  Dow acknowledged that dioxin,   which had been contaminating 2,4,5-T for years was ""the most toxic compound  they have ever experienced"", and that even trace amounts of  it caused incapacitating acne. By 1965, it was obvious that both companies  understood what sort of threat dioxin was, and yet there are no records  that Monsanto or Dow ever sent   communication to the US government  warning them about the threat. In fact, Dow's vice president reportedly said, ""If the government learns about this,  the whole industry will suffer."" As a result, the US sprayed South Vietnam  with 72 million liters of Agent Orange, within which was just 80 liters of dioxin. And even though that doesn't seem  like much, the damage was irreparable. Civilians and soldiers on both sides  suffered from skin diseases and cancer. Children were born with physical  and mental disabilities. By some estimates, as many as three million  people suffered from the effects of Agent Orange. This outraged the public. In 1967, 5,000 scientists signed a petition to the  president condemning his use of the herbicides. And Monsanto was under scrutiny too,   because regulators were catching on  to the dioxin contained in 2,4,5-T. The herbicide was about to be phased  out, compromising their bottom line. Monsanto needed a miracle,  and they needed it fast. Their idea was to replace  2,4,5-T with a safer herbicide. But after nine years of research,  they weren't getting anywhere. All of the scientists in  the Agricultural department   referred to this new initiative as a dead area. One of the last remaining scientists  on the project was John E. Franz, and by early 1970, he was about to give it up too. But before abandoning the project, Franz  decided to do one final set of experiments, so he thought up 19 possible  assets that could maybe work   as herbicides and decided to test them out. He prepped the first herbicide,  but nothing happened. The plant was completely fine,  and the herbicide had no activity. Then he decided to test the second  herbicide, and he applied it to a plant. It was 10 times more powerful than  any herbicide the team had ever seen. And allegedly, it made the plants super... It made the plants super nasty. That was disgusting. This miracle compound was glyphosate, a phosphonic acid group on one end and a  carboxyl group on the other with a nitrogen,   hydrogen, or amino group in between. To make sure it was commercially feasible,   Franz and his colleague set up  tests in these outdoor fields. And as one of the scientists was  getting back to these test sites,   he saw the results from the plane. It was clear as day. All he could do is write Eureka  across the performance report. It was the best herbicide they'd ever seen. What made it so great at killing plants? Well, for plants to survive,  they use a chemical pathway,   a series of reactions to create three important  amino acids, acids without which they die. This process is known as the  Shikimate pathway because it   starts with shikimic acid named  after the Japanese Shikimi flower. During one of the steps, two acids, S3P and  PEP need to transform into a third compound, but they can only do that with the  help of an enzyme called EPSPS, which catalyzes the reaction and  helps the two molecules combine. However, if glyphosate is  present during this reaction,   it will begin to mimic PEP because  they have a very similar geometry. And because of that, glyphosate actually binds   first to EPSPS blocking it  from acting as a catalyst. Now, the acids can't transform and the  whole Shikimate pathway is destroyed. Without it, there are no amino  acids and the plant dies. Crucially, the Shikimate pathway is unique  to plants and things like bacteria and fungi. Humans and animals don't have it. In fact, we have to eat foods that  contain these three amino acids. But for Monsanto, this was good  news because they could market   that glyphosate targets an enzyme found  in plants, but not in humans or pets. After decades of toxic products, Monsanto  finally had one which they were sure was safe. And research was also showing  that after you spray glyphosate,   the microorganisms in the soil  break it down into safe byproducts. It was biodegradable. Glyphosate was perfect, so they wasted  no time in getting it on the market. In 1974, Monsanto had a new hit herbicide... Roundup. Roundup is better. It goes through the plant to  kill it, tops and rhizomes. My roots hurt real bad. Hank, Hank! Roundup. No root, no weed, no problem. Farmers loved it because unlike  2,4-D, glyphosate killed every weed,   not just broad-leaved ones, but grassy too. It allowed them to practice  something called no-till farming. See, usually to get rid of weeds, you'd have to  plow up the entire field before planting anything, and that would hurt the soil,  and it was also just a lot work. But with Roundup, what you do is you  spray the whole field, everything dies, and then you just plant directly into the residue. It was easier, faster, and cheaper. And Roundup was safe to use too. They marketed it as safer than table  salt and safe enough to drink, basically. Roundup can be used where kids and pets will  play and breaks down into natural materials. By the late eighties, Monsanto  was selling seven million pounds   of Roundup and making a billion dollars each year. And they weren't going to share a  penny of that money with anyone. See, with other herbicides,  like for example, Alachlor,   which was moderately popular at the time, you can tweak the molecule a bit here or there,  and you still get a very potent weed killer, so if you patented a specific herbicide,   your competitors could still use  hundreds of its close relatives, which would still work perfectly well  without violating your patent rights. But glyphosate was different, if you were to modify the molecule in any way,  its herbicidal properties were completely gone, so Monsanto could rest easy  knowing that until the year 2000,   they would be the only ones able to sell it. But there was a little problem with glyphosate. See, unlike 2,4-D, which only killed  broadleaved weeds, Roundup kills everything. I sprayed some of my own houseplants  here and well, you can see the results. Chances are if it's green,  Roundup is going to kill it. And this was a problem because farmers could  only really spray Roundup on their field twice, either right before planting the  seeds or right after a harvest. But for Monsanto, this  wasn't as much of a problem. See, they thought if we could somehow make the  crops like soybean or corn resistant to Roundup, well then farmers could spray it on  their field during the whole year,   and it would keep killing the weeds, but not the Roundup resistant crops. Crops which Monsanto could sell them. And as a result, they would  have a complete monopoly   over both the herbicide and the seed supply. Monsanto's idea was this, if glyphosate blocks the EPSPS enzyme in plants   then they could edit the plant's DNA so  that the cells just create more EPSPS. If there's enough of the enzyme then  glyphosate can't block all of it,   and so the plant can still survive. They tried this out on  petunias, but it didn't work. The flowers would survive a tiny amount of  Roundup, but a normal dose would still kill them. Monsanto was kind of stumped, and  they didn't have time to rest, because while glyphosate and Roundup were under  their patents, a Roundup resistant seed wasn't. And their competitors knew this. In 1985, a company called Calgene published   a paper in nature showing that they made  tobacco slightly resistant to glyphosate. The paper showed promise, but more importantly,   it made it clear to Monsanto that  they were running out of time. Their researchers were desperate calling  this patent race the ""Manhattan Project"". And then one of the engineers had a genius idea. Monsanto had a ton of these factories where  they were converting phosphate into glyphosate, and they had a lot of sludge  leaching out of these factories, so if there was anything living  around these factories in this sludge,   there was a chance it was resistant to glyphosate. The researchers went to one of these factories,   scooped it out, and found a  strain of salmonella in there, which was surprising to them because salmonella  usually relies on the Shikimate pathway, but here it was thriving in glyphosate. Monsanto's scientists isolated  the salmonella's genetic sequence, and found that it had evolved a way to  mutate the shape of its EPSPS enzyme   so that glyphosate couldn't bind to  it and block the Shikimate pathway. The scientists took that salmonella  DNA and loaded it onto a gene gun,   not this one here, but it's  actually surprisingly similar. See, they placed thousands of these salmonella DNA   strips onto microscopic gold  particles in the gene gun, which they then fired into the plant tissue  all over, at 1,400 kilometers per hour. The gold particles would bombard the plant cells,  and some of them would make it into the nucleus. Here, the DNA detaches from the gold, and it  integrates itself into the plant's chromosomes. Now, every time this cell divides,  it copies over the new EPSPS gene. Monsanto scientists planted seeds with these genes  out in the field and sprayed them with Roundup, but nothing happened. The soybean was resistant. Monsanto made sure to act quickly soon  after they found even more potent bacteria,   and they were able to make  other crop species immune too. And by 1998, they had patents for glyphosate  resistant canola, corn, and cotton. They called this lineup of  GMO seeds Roundup Ready. These Roundup Ready seeds took  over the market in an instant. Already by 2001, more than 70%  of all soybeans grown in the US   were Monsanto's with Roundup making  them more than $2.5 billion a year. It was the best-selling agricultural product ever. And every farmer could join in on this  Roundup plus Roundup Ready revolution   just by signing Monsanto's  Technology Use Agreement. I've got one of these agreements from 2011  here, and I just wanted to read some terms. The grower or the farmer who accepts and wants to   use these seeds agrees to not save or clean  any crop produced from the seed for planting. And the farmer also agrees not to supply the seed  produced from the seed to anyone for planting, meaning you cannot save the seeds you  bought last year to plant this year, and you also cannot share or  sell your seeds to anyone else. Here's another one, the farmer agrees  to identify and allow Monsanto and its   representatives access to the land  farmed by the grower or the farmer. And this allows Monsanto to examine  and take samples of the crops,   crop residue or the seeds located therein. And here's a final one, the grower  accepts the terms of the following   notice requirements by signing this agreement, or by opening a bag of seeds. So you're agreeing to these terms  even just by opening a bag of seeds. If you thought that this contract was crazy,   you should see the stuff that  we sign up to today online. I have some terms and conditions  here from a social media website. Here's what it says. ""We may collect biometric identifiers,   and we may infer your attributes,  such as age range and gender."" So they're able to scan your face  and sell that data to advertisers. And just in the last couple of  months, companies have been making   these aggressive pushes to their terms and  conditions to try and get more of your data, and they can use it to train AI models  or just sell it to data brokers. And this doesn't just mean annoying  ads and spam emails and phone calls. Law enforcement can buy your data,  and normal people can buy it too. Even stuff like your location history. And all of that is perfectly legal, but luckily you can take steps to prevent it  with the help of today's sponsor, Incogni. See, I started using Incogni in June. Look, you can see that they already contacted  46 data brokers to delete my personal data, and 42 of those requests have been completed,  and I've actually been getting fewer spam emails. The new thing is that they now offer  an unlimited plan with custom removals. So if you are browsing online  and see a website with your data,   even though it shouldn't have the data, you can ask one of Incogni's experts  to manually take it down for you. And if you want to extend that  sort of protection to someone else,   they also have a family plan  that supports up to five members. To try it, go to incogni.com/veritasium,  and use the code Veritasium to get 60% off. You can also use this QR code. That's incogni.com/veritasium, or you can  also click the link in the description. I want to thank Incogni for  sponsoring this part of the video, and now back to farmers and the terms  and conditions they had to sign. Well, couldn't farmers just decide not  to use Monsanto's seeds and herbicide? The thing was, you have Roundup Ready  seeds and you spray them with Roundup,   everything's going to be fine on your end. But your neighbor doesn't  have Roundup Ready seeds, so if your herbicide drifts over to your  neighbor's side, it's going to kill his plants. So neighbors were concerned thinking  their crops were going to be lost, so they got Roundup Ready as well, and soon  enough, Monsanto controlled the whole market. And the control didn't end there. As one seed grower from Ohio remembers it,   Monsanto's salesman would tell  people they could either sign on, or they'd all be out of business  within the next two years. Monsanto was going to dominate  the entire seed industry, and there was nothing anybody could do about it. So hundreds of thousands of farmers  signed the deal, and it wasn't a good one. One evening in late July of 2004, an Indiana farmer named Dave Runyon was relaxing  at home when two men knocked on his door. They led me to believe that they  were doing a survey for a magazine. They wanted to know what kind of crops I planted. They wanted to know what kind of herbicides I  used, the seed I bought and purchased and used. Runyon wasn't interested, so  he decided to shut the door,   when he heard one of the men  say, ""I think he's guilty."" Runyon didn't know what they  meant, but a few months later, he got a letter from Monsanto saying that he had   seven days to turn over all of his  business records to the company. He was shocked, because Runyon was one of the few   farmers that never signed  a contract with Monsanto, and yet here they were threatening  to sue him for patent infringement. Apparently, someone had tipped Monsanto off that  Runyon had been replanting their seeds illegally, and farmers all across the country  were getting the same types of letters. Honestly, it's kind of hard to overstate  how much Monsanto tried to control farmers. They sent private detectives and ex-cops  to inspect farms all over the US, waving their terms and conditions of the contract   into farmers' faces to let  them onto their property. They hired plane and helicopter pilots to survey   the farmlands from above  for signs of infringement. The lawsuits, the threats. How could people possibly stand up to them? And they even had a company hotline,   1-800-ROUNDUP, that farmers could  call to snitch on their neighbors. It still exists. 1-800-ROUNDUP. You're calling them now? I think I got it right. If you have information about the misuse of  seed or a compliance issue, please press three. That phone number was in existence in the  same time that we're talking about there,   where people could rat out their neighbor. As Runyon himself puts it, ""There is  much mistrust in the countryside today. You never know who might report on you. You could actually willfully plant unauthorized   seed in somebody's land if  you want to destroy them."" Now, in 2010, Monsanto responded  to farmers' concerns about these   investigations and released a commitment  statement regarding their patents. They mentioned their pledge to  transparency and ethical behavior, properly introducing themselves  with displayed identification, and not exercising their patent rights when only   trace amounts of their seed is  present in a farmer's field. While Monsanto ultimately ended  up letting Runyon go, by 2013,   they sued over 400 farmers,  raking in over $20 million. Many of these farmers went bankrupt,   and countless others settled with Monsanto  out of court even if they were innocent, because they just couldn't risk the legal fees. You know, they were actually  influencing radio stations at one point, and the radio stations would  publicly say the name of the   people who were saving Roundup seeds on air. That sounds like a supervillain plot, really. Yeah, well people actually started  calling them Mon-satan, so... This culture of fear and paranoia  turned neighbors against each other,   especially in communities where some farmers  didn't wish to use Monsanto's herbicide system. One of those farmers was Mike Wallace. See, Mike had a field of soybean here that  wasn't resistant to Monsanto's herbicide, but his neighbor who was also growing  soybean did use Monsanto's system. Now, to be clear, this herbicide  wasn't glyphosate itself, it was   Monsanto's other herbicide product called Dicamba, but it was still packaged in this  Roundup and Roundup Ready system. Now, one day Mike noticed that some of  his soybean was dying, and he suspected   it was the herbicide from the neighboring  farm drifting over, killing his soybean, and he could tell this was the  case because the weeds underneath   the neighbor's soybean were dying,  allegedly because of the herbicide. And he believed this caused him around  a hundred thousand dollars in damages,   but the neighbor denied that it was his fault. Now, the tensions between the two farms grew,   so Mike wanted to chat with one of the workers  from the farm to discuss the situation. They met on a country field road near both  farms, and what happened next isn't really clear. Things got sour quickly. Allegedly, Mike grabbed the worker's arm, so  the worker pulled back and pulled out his gun, ""shooting Wallace until the gun was empty"". Similar kinds of tragedies were  happening all over the world. Monsanto infiltrated farming communities in India,  Argentina, Canada, Brazil, and even Vietnam. By the 2010s, they were an  almost untouchable monopoly. Then out of the blue on March 20th  2015, an independent science panel   called the International Agency  for Research on Cancer, or IARC, came out with this, a paper saying, ""Glyphosate is  probably carcinogenic to humans."" The most popular weed killer  in the world may cause cancer. IARC's classification of glyphosate  as a probable carcinogen. damage to chromosomes and DNA in human cells. This came as a shock to  everyone, especially Monsanto. They don't know how IARC could  reach a conclusion such as this one. See, other big health organizations, like the  US Environmental Protection Agency, the EPA, and even the World Health Organization, which  is actually the parent organization to IARC, both claimed that glyphosate posed no  carcinogenic risk to humans and animals. I think the IARC designation took  the public by such huge surprise, because Monsanto had really done  such a good job for 40-plus years   convincing the world that this  stuff was safer than table salt. Monsanto was furious about this  ruling, so on the same day,   they sent a scathing letter to  the World Health Organization complaining how this classification  needs to be rectified immediately. They claimed IARC chose to  disregard dozens of studies, and that conclusions on  glyphosate must be non-biased,   thorough, and based on quality science. Soon after, five review papers came out bashing   the IARC classification and  criticizing their decision. So why would IARC disagree  with all the other agencies,   and why would they ignore so many studies? Well, this is exactly the question California  lawyer Brent Wisner wanted to answer. Wisner had been looking into  Monsanto ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or a while now. Allegedly, Roundup was causing  a decline in the bee population,   so he thought he could make a case out of it. But one day, one of Wisner's colleagues  told him that her cousin-in-law had been   using Roundup on his farm for  as long as she could remember, and then both he and his dog developed  non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, or NHL,   a type of cancer targeting the lymphatic system, and he died in late 2015. He didn't stop using it until  he was too weak to do anything. He didn't think there was any danger with Roundup. See, the IARC paper that came out saying  glyphosate is a probable carcinogen   actually pointed out that the strongest  evidence was for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. And reports of Roundup users getting diagnosed  with NHL were popping up more frequently. This seemed like more than just a coincidence. Wisner thought he had a case, but Monsanto was  a corporate giant he couldn't tackle alone, so he teamed up with other lawyers,   and also an investigative journalist who'd  been reporting on Monsanto for decades. So there's a lot to write about. I spent a lot of time at Monsanto headquarters. It became pretty clear," """"This company  really doesn't care about its customers."""" Right", okay. Together, this group of lawyers  started a lawsuit against Monsanto,   and they forced them to hand  over their company documents. Monsanto had to comply, and  so the lawyers got access to   their internal emails, memos, and safety studies. Saying one thing publicly and saying  something completely different internally. The duplicity, the deception,  is just jaw-dropping, really. In 1983, Monsanto submitted a glyphosate   toxicology study to the EPA  to get it classified as safe, but the data was showing that mice receiving   higher doses of glyphosate were  developing rare kidney tumors. The EPA was obviously worried with this,"   and they wanted to classify glyphosate  as a possible human carcinogen. So they asked Monsanto to do more studies. And Monsanto fought back against that. """"No", you just need to trust  what we're telling you. You're reading the data  wrong, et cetera et cetera. Monsanto wouldn't comply, and they  pushed back against the EPA until 1989,   when the EPA suddenly changed its mind. They said," """"A repeat of the mouse oncogenicity  will not be required at this time."""" And instead", in 1991, the EPA classified   glyphosate as having evidence of  non-carcinogenicity for humans. The cancer concern in mice was never made public,   and this new classification  certainly helped push Roundup sales, at least until more independent research came in. See, one of the most influential research papers  on Roundup actually came out in the year 2000. It was the Safety Evaluation and Risk  Assessment of the Herbicide Roundup   and its Active Ingredient Glyphosate for Humans, commonly just called Williams,  Kroes, and Munro after its authors. This was the landmark paper on glyphosate safety,   which concluded that Roundup herbicide  does not pose a health risk to humans. This paper was cited over  1200 times, which is a lot. And it was considered then by regulators  of the foundational research paper to say   that glyphosate was safe, this independent paper. Except the paper wasn't independent at all. See, Monsanto's director of the  toxicology group, William Heydens, was listed on the paper as someone  who provided scientific support. So in a 2017 deposition, Wisner and his fellow  lawyers decided to ask Heydens about it. Were your contributions in your view  to the Williams paper substantial? No, they were not. As I said, they were editorial,"  just to make it easier to read. But here's how Heydens referred to his  involvement in the paper internally. """"I have sprouted several new gray hairs  during the writing of this thing"," or """"I'll strangle Kroes or Williams  if they ask for any rewrites!!"""" And much later"," """"We would be keeping  the cost down by us doing the writing   and they would just edit and  sign their names"," so to speak. Recall that is how we handled  Williams Kroes and Munro."""" And they celebrated when it was finally done. You see in their internal documents",   they talk about how this is going to be  our defense, glyphosate around the world. The patterns of Monsanto's manipulation  were just popping up everywhere. They tried to change glyphosate cancer  classifications at different agencies. They seemingly colluded with corrupt EPA  officials to try and kill opposing research. And they ghost-wrote safety studies. By mid 2017, Wisner released all of  these internal documents to the public,   now known as the Monsanto Papers. People were furious. Newly released docs show Monsanto executives  colluding with corrupted EPA officials. Would try to influence media and science reports. Monsanto appears to have been caught red-handed. We have a paper trail that goes back to the 1980s. Stakes for Monsanto are extremely high. Soon, lawyers were overwhelmed  with calls from cancer patients   who used Roundup and got diagnosed with NHL. They wished to be included in the lawsuit. By the end of the year, more than  3000 victims had signed onto the case. But Monsanto tried to do everything  to dismantle these carcinogen claims. You remember the five independent papers that   came out bashing the IARC decision to  call glyphosate a probable carcinogen? Well, the main review article  there was ghostwritten by Monsanto. So you could see this paper getting edited  and changed by people who worked for Monsanto. And it has been frustrating  to see journals basically   at every step of the way declining to retract. That paper is still online today,  and Monsanto went all the way to   discredit anyone who is opposing their view with something called their  'Let Nothing Go' Strategy. Let Nothing Go is essentially  like, let nothing go. Somebody tweets online, Roundup  causes cancer, you don't let that go. You have an onslaught of  people responding to that. They had whole training operations where  they would bring in nutritionists and   academics and other people to train  them what to say and how to say it. I do not believe that glyphosate in  Argentina is causing increases in cancer. You can drink a whole quart  of it and it won't hurt you. You want to drink some? We have some here. I'd be happy to actually. But not really. Not really? I know it wouldn't hurt me. I mean, if you say so, I have some glyphosate. No, no, I'm not stupid. But they very much became  an army that Monsanto could   deploy when a news article came out, for instance. Are we going to get some comments under this  video that are actually written by Monsanto? I wouldn't be surprised. But all of the confusion Monsanto tried  to create around glyphosate wasn't enough. By the summer of 2018, the truth was out and over  11,000 plaintiffs filed lawsuits against Monsanto. This was going to destroy them. But unfortunately, Monsanto had an escape plan. Just as the first lawsuit  against them was starting, they signed an acquisition deal  with German chemical giant, Bayer. Monsanto cashed in, the executives rode off into  the sunset, and Bayer was left holding the bag. Why would Bayer buy Monsanto? If it's so obvious that they have hundreds of  thousands of plaintiffs waiting for a verdict, why would a company do something like that? Well, I think that's the big question that  the investors are asking, or have asked. Why in God's name did you do this? Why did you do this? I think it was Wall Street  Journal that had a headline,   Worst Acquisition in History,  or something like that. Bayer stock tanked immediately after the  acquisition, and things only got worse for them. A few months later, the first case against  the Monsanto-Bayer company went to trial. The plaintiff was Dewayne Lee Johnson, who had developed non-Hodgkin lymphoma after  accidentally getting doused with Roundup at work. The jury faced with evidence from the  Monsanto Papers sided with Johnson, awarding him $289 million in  damages, and Bayer had to pay up. By 2025, Bayer had to settle  more than a hundred thousand   cancer lawsuits for the damages  caused by Monsanto's Roundup, amounting to over $10 billion in settlements. Monsanto, which is now owned by  Germany's Bayer, denies any wrongdoing. And they don't accept that Roundup could  have caused the plaintiffs' cancer. So after all this publicity and scandal,  how dangerous is Roundup really? My question has always been, if it doesn't cause cancer and it's not dangerous  and there's no real risk to human health, why in God's name would Monsanto have to spend   millions and millions and millions of  dollars to create ghostwritten studies, and hire PR companies to  ghostwrite articles online? And why would you have to engage in so much  deception if you truly had a safe product, right? Well, according to IARC, one of the biggest  concerns with glyphosate is genotoxicity. Some studies have shown that if  you get overexposed to glyphosate,   like many farmers would, then the chemical might substantially  damage the DNA in your cells,   which is a common mechanism of  action for many carcinogens. And other studies have actually  pointed to the shikimate pathway. Again, we don't use it, but  the bacteria in our gut do. So if you ingest trace amounts of glyphosate,   for example, through your food, it  could disrupt your gut's microbiome. If you can disrupt the enzyme  in the microflora in your gut,   the EPSP enzyme, the synthase, it  could have all sorts of effects. Now, IARC never specified at what dose  glyphosate actually becomes dangerous. Just that overall glyphosate  is a probable carcinogen. And to put it into context, the other things  in the same classification category are   eating red meat or high temperature  frying or pulling a night shift. But these are lower than the number one  category, which is a certain carcinogen. And here of course you have  alcohol and tobacco and sunlight. And to give you context from our  previous episode on Forever Chemicals, PFOA was a category one, so a certain carcinogen, but PFOS is actually a category 2B, which is lower  than glyphosate at only a possible carcinogen. From the data I've seen, glyphosate doesn't  seem to be a particularly potent carcinogen, but high exposure to glyphosate  is certainly associated with a   modest increase in your ability  to get certain types of cancers. And people who have higher exposures  are clearly at higher risk. Yeah. However, the EPA and many other organizations  like the European Food Safety Authority still   disagree with the IARC and claim that  glyphosate isn't a likely carcinogen. But the courts in the United  States have repeatedly told   the EPA that they're not doing a proper analysis, they're not doing a proper assessment of  glyphosate, they're not following their own rules. You said something like 50% of the  papers that were about glyphosate   safety and research and toxicity  were probably industry funded. Yeah, that's just a guess off the top of my head. Honestly, it could be much higher than 50%. I certainly do not think it's lower than that. There's just always a desire by these  companies to control the science. Today, Bayer still denies that  glyphosate is a carcinogen. They would still tell you, they don't  think there's anything wrong with it. Yeah. When my book came out, Bayer reached  out to me, they sent me an email. And it was really kind of quite strange. It was like," """"Congratulations. We've read your book and we've learned  a lot."""" I think Bayer feels different. And Bayer actually removed  glyphosate from commercial products. So this bottle of Roundup here doesn't  even have glyphosate in it anymore. Part of the reason for that must be  the public backlash and the lawsuits",   but the other reason is that it  doesn't work that well anymore. We overused glyphosate. See, since the 1970s, more than 60 species  of weed have become resistant to glyphosate,   just like that first salmonella  sample found near the factory. What do they put in those Roundup  sprays, if not glyphosate? Well, mostly full circle, so it's 2,4-D. Isn't that crazy? Well, you know, many people will probably go   through life not being affected  in the slightest by glyphosate. But others may develop cancer or other disease, and that's why it's really important to  protect the most sensitive individuals. I think another part of the problem here is how   a company as big as Monsanto  can just infiltrate academia. They have these big resources so they can just  push around scientists and manipulate results. They create so much confusion, and  then they just avoid the punishment. When you don't create firewalls between  the regulated and the regulators, you have created distrust in science. Inherently, science is  always going to be political. It's never going to be disconnected  from the realities of the world,   it's always socially constructed. But we can do a lot of things to put  rules and regulations in place to try   and make sure that there's a better sense of  independence and disconnection between this. I want to shout out two books," Carey Gillam's 'The  Monsanto Papers' and Bart Elmore's 'Seed Money'. They were both incredibly valuable  in researching this topic. And I also want to shout out people  in the comments of our previous video   on PFAS suggesting that we should cover Monsanto. Thank you for suggesting that idea. And thank you as always for watching.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AFXLZ7FEJc4,This is the natural disaster to worry about,,Educational,"- [Derek] What happens if I heat up this rubber band? When you heat materials like glass or plastic, the atoms vibrate faster. They get slightly farther apart and this reduces intermolecular forces. So the material gets weaker. Under tension, it stretches. But when I heat up this rubber band, the opposite happens. It actually pulls more strongly. The rubber band contracts and the weight goes up. So why does this happen? Well, rubber is unlike any other material. It's waterproof. As it's breaking, it actually becomes tougher and it can stretch up to 10 times its length and bounce back no worse for wear. These properties have made it essential for modern life. It forms the tubes and seals that carry our gas and water, the belts that drive our motors and the tires on our cars, trucks and planes. Even trains use rubber in their suspension systems. It's a perfectly engineered material but we didn't invent it. All of our most durable rubber still comes from a single natural source. This tree, it's a source at risk of being wiped out. And if that happens, the results could be devastating. - You're talking about a complete global societal meltdown. - This could be considered a national security issue. - You wouldn't think that we're so dependent on this thing? - Well, we are, and most people don't know that. They're waiting for a disaster to happen. - [Derek] Rubber comes from the Brazilian rubber tree. As early as 1600 BC, Mesoamericans cut the bark to release this milky white liquid, now known as latex. They noticed that if they let it dry, it turned into this stretchy, waterproof solid lump. To see this in person, we sent Veritasium producer and mechanical engineer, Henry van Dyck to the Akron Research and Development Laboratory, where they specialize in all things rubber. - In just all these racks, even though they look solid, they're all flowing right now. - Really? - If you look behind one of these racks, you can see these are actually dripping. - Oh, wow. - They're flowing slower than we can perceive. - [Derek] Unprocessed rubber is not the rubber we're used to. It slowly flows and can't maintain its shape. So how do you get this weird material in the first place? Well, just underneath the bark are special tube-like cells that carry the latex. Floating around inside are lots of isopentenyl pyrophosphate or IPP. This is the building block or monomer of rubber. In fact, IPP is found everywhere in nature, including inside you. - Huge amounts of us are dependent upon that little molecule. We make short chain rubber in our livers. It's called Dolichol. You're busily making rubber, you are a rubber factory. - How? What do you mean? Why am I making rubber? - It's essential for cell membranes. - [Henry] Special builder enzymes grab these monomers to build this long chain with over 10,000 monomers, they build a polymer. This is rubber. - So I get students to think about if this is a carbon atom and then I've got my next carbon atom along the chain next to it, yeah? And then, I've got my next carbon atom. How many do we have to make up the whole length of the chain? Well, we've got tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of carbons along the back burn. You start going kilometers in distance from end to end if each atom is the size of this tennis ball. - [Derek] But the polymers aren't stretched out from end to end like that. Instead, they're all coiled up. - If you imagine the room that I'm in right now and I had the first ball here in the middle, the chances of the end of the chain leaving this room is quite small. - [Derek] So after you've dried out the latex, you're left with raw rubber, a jumble of all these polymers. And this is why it's flowing. Because over time, all those polymers slowly slide past each other. Now, when you pull on the rubber and let go, it bounces back. So why is this? - At room temperature, rubber's polymer chains are constantly vibrating and bumping into each other. And other smaller molecules like air molecules or trapped water molecules also jostle around and bump into the chains. Now, when you stretch rubber, these chains straighten out. But as you're doing this, those chains are still being bombarded by these smaller molecules. So when you release that stress, there's nothing holding those chains aligned anymore. And the constant bombardment from the smaller molecules and the other chains kinks those chains back up. So the rubber snaps back to its original size. And if you heat the rubber up, well then, everything is vibrating faster and so the chains are gonna get kinked up even more so the rubber pulls back stronger. - [Derek] This is why when you heat up rubber, it shrinks. - Rubber band's fascinating. To think that when they're sitting on an old package of papers for a long time holding those papers together, it's done by a perpetual pounding, pounding, pounding of the atoms against these chains to hold it, trying to kink them and trying to kink them. - [Derek] But there's also another reason why rubber is so stretchy. If you zoom in on a chain, you'll see that the monomers are attached to each other on the same side of the double bond. This is called cis-attachment. And it affects how the chain folds. On each monomer, there are three single bonds that can rotate to be at an angle or in line but these carbons with two hydrogens take up a lot of space. So it's favorable for at least one of these bonds to be at an angle. That makes the polymer wiggle in and out like a folded ribbon. So when you pull on a piece of rubber, first, all the polymers line up but then, each chain also unfolds. The wiggle makes rubber extra stretchy. But this state is very rare. All three bonds lined up is only one possible arrangement for any monomer. And one polymer usually has thousands of monomers. So after you release the stress, the chain goes from an improbable state, completely aligned to a more probable one, with wiggles. The chain itself bounces back. This is where rubber gets its elasticity from. So natural rubbers straight from the tree is already stretchy. It's also waterproof since all those chains are just a bunch of carbon and hydrogen atoms which are hydrophobic. But as we've seen, it eventually loses its shape. Plus, if you stretch it too much, it breaks quite easily. So we need to do more to get the rubber we're used to today. Early Mesoamericans improved the rubber slightly by mixing the latex with juice from the tropical morning-glory, a local flower. And they used this to form sandals, bottles and balls. - But for the next 3,000 years to the rest of the world, rubber was little more than a curiosity. Then in 1770, a piece of natural latex made its way to English chemist, Joseph Priestley. And he took this piece and used it to try to erase pencil marks. He noticed that it easily, quote, ""rubbed them away."" - [Derek] In the following decades, people started exploring other applications. Up until then, people used to waterproof fabric with oil, wax, or tar. But some oils were extremely flammable and prone to spontaneous combustion. And wax or tar would eventually crack with movement. Similarly, there were no real good flexible materials at the time. Leather was the best option but it had little give. Rubber had the potential to fix all those problems. So for the next 50 years, the use of rubber exploded. In England, people made waterproof clothing. And by the late 1820s, the rubber craze hit the US when everyone wanted their own pair of Brazilian waterproof boots. Factories sprung up all across the country to make new rubber products, including one New England factory called the Roxbury India Rubber Company. - In the spring of 1834, things were looking great for the company. The previous fall, they had sold over $20,000 worth of goods, rubber coats, shoes and the like. But as the summer came round, problems started to emerge. - They used to rubberize the fabric to make it water-resistant which was fine until you sat down on a wooden bench on a hot day and you stuck to it. - [Derek] See, all natural rubber has a critical weakness. It's extremely sensitive to temperature changes. It melts when it gets too hot and it freezes and becomes brittle when it gets too cold. - This made the coats and shoes practically useless during the hot summer. So customers returned their items on mass. Then, things went from bad to worse. One day, the Roxbury manager visited the warehouse. When he opened the door, he didn't see their newest products. Instead, he was met with a foul smell and a molten, gooey mess that covered the entire warehouse. - In fact, when we ordered some raw rubber, we were in for a similar nasty surprise. Oh, that is disgusting. The summer heat melted their rubber products and they started rotting. The sludge stank so badly, the manager had the employees secretly bury it at night. - [Derek] But later in that horrible summer, the manager got a visit from a man named Charles. Charles' previous business had gone bankrupt and he was deeply in debt. - He stumbled upon a rubber life preserver and he thought he could make a better valve. He pitched the Roxbury manager on his new design, hoping to pay back his lenders. The manager was impressed but couldn't buy Charles' work. He showed Charles the warehouse full of rotten rubber. Rubber had potential but in its current form, it was just too problematic. However, he said if anyone could figure out how to make rubber stable in a wider temperature range and non-sticky, well, then that person would stand to make a ton of money. So Charles was determined to become that person. But when he returned home to start his experiments, he was met by an angry creditor who threw Charles into debtor's prison for unpaid loans. Charles asked his wife to bring him raw rubber and her rolling pin. There in his jail cell, he started adding different compounds into raw rubber. - If rubber was naturally sticky, then why couldn't you add dry powders to absorb that stickiness? So he tried adding magnesia and he got a smooth non-sticky rubber. But over time, the stickiness returned. After his release, he tested the wear and tear of his rubber compounds by walking around in all rubber outfits. - [Henry] His hands were always covered with gum elastic. He playfully said that the only way to rub rubber off was by rubbing more on. - Some mixtures showed promise, but eventually, they'd all rot into a sticky mess. So he kept borrowing money to fund his experiments but because his mixtures all eventually failed, he ended up in debtor's prison so many times that he jokingly called it his hotel. But Charles refused to give up. When a friend told him rubber is dead, Charles replied, ""I am the man to bring it back."" In the summer of 1838, he met Nathaniel Hayward, a businessman and inventor. Hayward had done his own experiments with rubber. At one point, he laid out a sheet of rubber and sprinkled on sulfur powder. And when he let this sheet set in the sun, he noticed that it hardened and had a smooth and non-sticky surface. - But eventually, it would still melt in the heat and freeze in the cold. He offered his process to his previous company but it was so horribly smelly that they rejected it. But Charles saw the possibilities. So he helped Hayward get a patent and then he bought it so that he could use it in his own experiments. Then one day in the winter of 1839, Charles accidentally dropped a piece of rubber mixed with sulfur on a hot stove. When he went to scrape it off, he found that instead of melting, it had charred and hardened. His daughter later said, ""As I was passing in and out of the room, I casually observed the little piece of gum,"" which he was holding near the fire. And he was unusually animated by some discovery which he had made. He nailed the piece of gum outside the kitchen door in the intense cold. In the morning, he brought it in, holding it up exultingly. He had found it perfectly flexible as it was when he put it out. - So he had made a new rubber with completely different properties, one that seemed to be temperature-resistant and much stronger. In fact, we're going to test out unprocessed rubber against rubber processed in this way. - Okay, so this is uncured rubber and I'm gonna see how far I can pull it. Uncured rubber is very soft and stretches really far before easily breaking. Oh, oh, it's gonna hurt, ah! We need to cure it. - What does it smell like to you? - Smells like a barbecue. - This smells like a barbecue. - The smell of rubber does not seem to be natural. - Mm. - Like it smells very chemically like it was made in the factory. - Yeah, so when I was in the factory and I saw the natural rubber, it smelled just like a barbecue. And the reason is they take the sap from the rubber tree which is latex and then they smoke it. - [Derek] They're smoking it? - [Henry] Yeah. - Like you'd smoke some salmon? - Yeah. - They smoke the rubber sheets to get rid of excess moisture and to preserve it by getting rid of the bacteria. This gives most natural rubber a sort of brownish color. So step one, add the rub. - [Barry] One at a time. - [Henry] Next, you add several powders including sulfur. Everything is mixed and heated to get a much stronger rubber. - Just pull it, straight off. - Yeah, that's wild. Yeah, no. - Pretty tough. - It is tough, eh? Now, yeah, now it's like wicked hard, yeah. Now at 393 kilopascals, the uncured rubber broke after extending just under 900% of its original length. At the same stress, the cured rubber had only stretched around 5%. It eventually broke at 14.1 megapascals after stretching nearly 600% of its original length. So what was it about sulfur and heat that changed the properties so dramatically? Well, chemically, sulfur powder is just rings of eight sulfur atoms. On the hot stove, the sulfur ring broke apart into smaller pieces. And now, those sulfur atoms or sulfur chains have free bonding sites so they look for places to attach. What likely happened is they grabbed onto a carbon atom from a rubber chain, breaking its double bond and attached itself. Then with another free bonding site, it grabbed onto a carbon atom from a different rubber chain, breaking its double bond and linking the two rubber chains together. This cross-linking forms flexible bridges of one, two or even more sulfur atoms in a row. Now, think about what this does to the rubber. Instead of each chain being loose and slippery like spaghetti, they're tied together in a flexible but connected network. So now, if rubber sits out in the sun on a hot summer's day, the tight bonds prevent it from melting. And in the cold, the cross-links make it harder for the rubber to fully freeze so it's less brittle and harder to break. And when you pull on the rubber, the chains stretch just as before. But as you release it, everything returns to its original position because it's all connected. So the cross-links make the rubber stronger, more resistant to temperature changes and more elastic. In fact, by tweaking the number and properties of these cross-links, you can change the properties of rubber. If you have a lot of cross-links, all the rubber chains are bound tightly together so the rubber becomes harder and stiffer. Great for things like shoe soles and tires that need to be durable but still a little flexible. If you have shorter cross-links, each link is harder to break. So the rubber is more resistant to heat and weathering. This is useful for seals and insulators. And if you have longer cross-links, the rubber chains can move more freely, so you can stretch it more before it breaks. That's perfect in the medical field for soft and flexible applications. So the cross-links are essential to stabilizing rubber. When Hayward sprinkled sulfur powder on rubber sheets, the heat from the sun did cause some cross-linking but only on the surface. When Charles kneaded in sulfur and then heated the entire mixture, the cross-links grew throughout the entire sample. So now, the results were much better. Eventually, this process was called vulcanisation after the Roman God, Vulcan, who was associated with heat and sulfur in volcanoes. Over the next five years, Charles perfected his method of vulcanisation. And then he patented it in 1844. With this, he transformed rubber from a curiosity into a material of endless possibilities. Little did he know that he actually wasn't the first to discover it. The Mayans or the Aztecs used, like, created rubber where they also vulcanising rubber, or was this the-? - They actually were. - In fact, Charles' discovery was very similar to what the Mesoamericans had been doing for thousands of years. They'd taken the juice from the morning-glory which contained sulfur, mixed it with natural latex, and then by laying it out in the sun, it would heat up and actually naturally create the cross-links that he'd discovered in his kitchen. Why did the Europeans, like, why did they have to reinvent the whole thing? Why didn't they just ask them? - Well, they hadn't even noticed, I don't think. - No. In the decades after Charles's invention, tons and tons of products were invented or improved with rubber. - [Announcer] Richards makes bold claim he could cross Pacific in this outfit. - [Derek] The inflatable bicycle tire arrived in 1888, the first rubber gloves for medical purposes in 1890, and the first car tire in 1895, and all of this was thanks to Charles' invention. - But despite almost single-handedly transforming the rubber industry, he never made much money. I mean he spent thousands of dollars defending his inventions in patent disputes. And when he passed away in 1860 at the age of 59, he was over $200,000 in debt. That would be around 7.7 million today. 38 years later, American entrepreneur, Frank Seiberling, founded a tire company and decided to name it in honor of rubber's inventor, Charles Goodyear. Today, the Goodyear company makes $18.9 billion a year in revenue and it's the third largest tire manufacturer in the world. For the past hundred years, tires have consumed the most natural rubber out of any application. But vulcanised rubber alone isn't strong enough and would wear down quickly, lasting only around 8,000 kilometers. So in the early 1900s, car and tire companies started experimenting with additives, including something called carbon black. - So with natural rubber, we got carbon black. - Reinforcement. - Which is gonna add the cross-linking. - This doesn't do the cross-linking. - No, it doesn't? - So this is the reinforcement in filler. - Ah, okay. - This makes it durable and resilient. - [Derek] Nowadays, passenger car tires last about 100,000 kilometers. Carbon black is what gives them their color and durability. - But carbon black has another benefit. It conducts electricity. - That's hugely important because as you're driving down the road, you are charging up the vehicle. If you didn't dissipate that static charge, then you would get a shock when you earth the car, when you touch the car. - But later, some companies wondered if they could reduce rolling friction by using a different additive. So they tried silica instead, making a whitish-looking tire. But silica is a poor conductor and rubber itself is an insulator. So now, as the car moved, it would slowly build up charge. - As you go to refuel the car, you have a highly charged, static electricity-charged vehicle, you put an earth conductor, the fuel hose into the tank, you create a spark in the tank, car explodes. There's a very vital characteristic of tires is that they should be conductive. The other benefit is if you're in a thunderstorm and you are struck by lightning, the lightning will hit the car. It will act as a fire enclosure, it'll completely protect you and it'll dissipate down to the ground. - [Derek] So people have stuck to using carbon black for most of the tire and only a little silica in the treads. - And since Goodyear's invention, we've made over 70 billion tires. If they were stacked on top of each other, they could go to the moon and back 21 times. - [Derek] And almost all of these tires needed natural rubber. But fueling the rubber boom came at a price, especially early on. In the late 19th century, the Amazon region supplied over 90% of the world's rubber but wild rubber trees were often separated by hundreds of meters. So to keep up with growing demand, rubber barons began to exploit natives killing roughly 40,000 people in the Putumayo region alone, and likely over 100,000 across the wider Amazon region between 1879 and 1911. The humanitarian activist Roger Casement said that, ""It was first called 'India Rubber,' because it came from the Indies, and the earliest European use of it was to rub out or erase. It is now called India rubber because it rubs out or erases the Indians."" - [Katrina] It is one of the most appalling instances of genocide and sickening ill-treatment of native peoples. - [Derek] But other countries like England weren't happy with Brazil's monopoly. So in 1876, the bio-pirate Henry Wickham managed to smuggle 70,000 rubber seeds back to England. The British Empire planted these seeds all over Southeast Asia which had a similar climate. Only now, instead of having just a few rubber trees here and there, they made farms of acres and acres of nothing but rubber trees. These plantations produced far more than the Amazon. Brazil's share of the rubber supply dropped from over 80% in 1907 to 1.6% just over three decades later. By the mid 1930s, over 90% of all rubber came from the British colonies in Southeast Asia. And two-thirds of that rubber went into making car tires. One of the largest car manufacturers at the time was Ford which made an average of 1.5 million cars every year. And Henry Ford wasn't comfortable with England's monopoly. So in 1928, he bought 10,000 square kilometers of land from the Brazilian government to build a utopian town. He called it Fordlandia. It had Cape Cod cottages, a hospital, swimming pools, a golf course and little red fire hydrants. It was an American city in the middle of the Amazon. It could house 10,000 people, all working to plant millions of rubber trees. - [Newscaster] Ford Plantation is a successful enterprise, a tribute to skill and science. - [Derek] But in the early 1930s, things started to go wrong. Every morning, the workers would wake up, walk to the line of rubber trees and they'd notice black spots. Just a few at first, little specks on the undersides of the leaves, like flakes of soot. But by the afternoon, they'd spread to cover the leaves entirely. And the next morning, the leaves were falling off. Shortly after that, the tree died. Every day, another row of trees was infected and dying. - People who've seen it say it looks like a fire front. You have the infected trees and it's green on one side and black on the other. And you see that black line move day by day, you could virtually watch it move and leaving dead trees behind it. - [Derek] The trees were infected by the South American leaf blight, a fungus native to South America. This blight ruined the 3.6 million rubber trees from Ford's plantations by the early 1940s, turning it into a disaster. When planting his rubber trees, instead of separating them by hundreds of meters like they were in the wild, he planted them several meters apart. 200,000 of them. - [Katrina] They're all touching, their roots are touching, their leaves are touching, their branches are touching. And so it's just like a plague, one straight through the plantation. - Ford tried relocating the project to a town downstream, Belterra, planting another 16,000 acres with rubber trees but these too all died. - [Derek] Ford's son eventually abandoned the project in 1945. The Fordlandia buildings still stand in Brazil abandoned. - And to this day, there is no cure for the leaf blight. The blight is so fatal to rubber trees, they can't grow in plantations in their native country. That's why South America makes up less than 2% of the rubber supply. Over 90% comes from Asia which is why it is so essential to prevent the spread of the leaf blight to Southeast Asia. - [Derek] Virtually, all of the rubber trees in Southeast Asia came from those seeds Henry Wickham stole. And newer trees are just clones of the old ones. so the farms are essentially just one big monoculture. - As a consequence of that, we are particularly prone to the potential outbreaks of fungus and things like that. If you get a fungal infection in Malaysia, then you would end up dramatically reducing global production of rubber. - So what's the outcome if we were cut off from rubber? - If SALB gets established in Southeast Asia and you lose natural rubber, then you're talking about a complete global societal meltdown. You're left now with making synthetic rubber tires at the most. Worst case, they can't make them. You can't make a truck tire, you won't have any airplanes. But the real potential is urban famine, for over 50% of the world's population is in cities. How will you move food into the cities to feed them? - But something like this did wipe out a large part of the rubber supply just six years ago. In 2019, two different diseases jumped from palm trees to rubber trees in Thailand. - In six months, these diseases had spread across seven countries and a million acres of trees. And the next year saw a 10% drop in production. - And the only reason it didn't destroy more trees was because of a different outbreak that we all remember. - COVID comes in early 2020. It stopped the spread of these diseases as a byproduct of trying to stop the spread of COVID. If COVID hadn't hit there, how far would that have gone? How many more millions of acres would've, in effect, been killed or seriously compromised by these two leaf blights? - Granted, it's hard to predict what would happen if we ran out of natural rubber. Some say the impact could be catastrophic. Grounded planes, failed railways, even famine and any disruption to the oil supply chain would send shockwaves through synthetic rubber products. But oil is such a polarizing and politically-charged topic, deeply tied to global power struggles and hidden incentives, that it's hard to know what's truly at stake. That's why we specifically ask Ground News to sponsor this video. They gather news sources from around the world in one spot. So you can read about the same issue from different perspectives, put the context needed to separate facts from politics. For example, Iran controls a single strait that handles roughly 20% of the world's oil. What happens when they threaten to close it amid US strikes on their nuclear sites? Well, on the topic, USA today ran oil hits five-month high after US strikes key Iranian nuclear sites. But the New York Post led with US stocks surge after restrained around attack on US base. One headline warned to a looming energy crisis, the other stock market rally and strategic restraint. It's the same event but completely different conclusions. In times of uncertainty, knowing who is telling you the story and why is just as important as knowing what actually happened. Ground News helps you do that by showing you the split headlines and surfacing stories hidden from your usual news feeds due to bias through their blind spot feed. In fact, the Nobel Peace Center called Ground News ""an excellent way to stay informed, avoid echo chambers and to expand your worldview."" And I agree. If we want to properly understand the crises affecting us here at home and around the world, we need better tools. And I can't recommend Ground News as that tool enough.

I'd like to thank Ground News for sponsoring this video and now, back to rubber. - We take natural rubber for granted in a huge number of different products. So if you take a typical car, there's something close to 250-300 rubber components within the car. You would have a nightmare trying to re-engineer all of those out of synthetic materials. - If we were to lose natural rubber and just rely on synthetic rubber, would it still be possible to do those applications? - So this has happened in the past. If you think about it, all of these synthetic polymers come from that initial thought process that we can't get natural rubber, we have to create other stuff. It's a national security issue. - That's wild. - You're just like, oh, it's a tire. But think about it, if you don't have tires, you can't move a military. - Yeah, yeah. The obvious question is, if natural rubber is so great, why can't we just replicate it in the lab? And that's the exact thing that the US tried when during the Second World War, Japan cut it off from roughly 97% of the world's natural rubber supply. - Modern war cannot be won without rubber. - What then happened was an enormous investment by the US, equivalent to $11.1 billion in today's terms, into synthetic rubber and growing alternative natural rubber crops. - That's roughly a third of the Manhattan project. It was a complete gamble but the four big US tire companies were able to improve and manufacture a synthetic rubber called styrene-butadiene in less than three years. Unlike natural rubbers, styrene-butadiene is made from two monomers. Roughly 25% styrene and 75% butadiene, both usually come from crude oil refining. The monomers are dispersed in water and combined into long chains in a random arrangement. Then, the rubber is vulcanised. Now, compared to natural rubber, it doesn't wear down as quickly under friction but it has a much lower tensile strength. In 1942, the US used 99.6% natural rubber and 0.4% synthetic. But in 1945, it was practically reversed at 14% natural and 86% synthetic. Now, almost 70% of all rubber consumed is synthetic and the most common one is still styrene-butadiene. But there are some things that natural rubber is just better at. - If you think about airplane tires, it's absolutely incredible that they're up there umpteen degrees below zero before they start to come into land. And then you've got this huge weight of the airplane on these dinky little tires that increase in temperature enormously over an incredibly small space of time and only natural rubber can do it. So airplane tires are essentially 100% natural rubber and you can't land if you've got synthetic in the tire. - So what can natural rubber do that we just can't replicate? - Okay, what I want you to think about. - Yeah. - Is you start to stretch it, this first movement. - Yeah. - Hardly, it's very easy to stretch that bit. - Yeah. - That first bit, I assume. Now, think about how much force you're using to continue to stretch it. - Yeah, it gets harder. - Now, it gets harder and harder and harder and harder. - It feels like, yeah, it could snap. - And then eventually, you'll get to a break point. - Yeah, yeah. - But what's happening, why it's getting harder is that the rubber is getting stronger as you stretch it. - [Derek] As you stretch the polymers, they start to align and stick together through weak intermolecular forces called Van der Waal's forces. When they're packed tightly enough, the polymers freeze together in thin sheetlike crystals aligned in the direction you stretch. And as you keep pulling, more and more polymers join the crystal structure. Each crystal acts as a new cross-link, making the rubber harder and stronger. - That ability to form crystalite prevents tear. So if you have crack propagation, it hits a crystal and can't go any further. - [Derek] In a sample without a crack, the stress is evenly distributed. But if there is a crack, more load flows right to the edge so the rubber stretches more. That area forms more crystals so it becomes harder to break. The crystals stop the crack growth until a threshold is reached. And then, it breaks. This is what makes natural rubber so durable. It's self-reinforcing under stress, stopping cracks in their tracks. - Crystallization is what makes natural rubber so good for tough applications. - The plane can weigh 5, 600 tons. So if you think about that, you've gotta, you know, each tire is taking 20 tons. And it's coming from a very cold temperature up there, yeah? It's -50, -60, depending exactly how high you've been flying. And you go from zero rotational speed quite fast, very fast and you get generate a lot of frictional heat really quickly as well. There's a reason why they make tires for planes out of natural rubber and that's because it's really demanding application. And the crystallization helps a huge amount preserve those tires and help them last. - [Derek] One study notes th",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
t," """"Experiment has shown that no detectable crack propagation occurs in rubber undergoing crystallization until the stress is so high as to generate abrupt catastrophic fracture."""" - Oh", that was fast. - That was fast. - And then eventually, you'll get to a break point. And yet you finally overcame it. - [Derek] When you pull on a rubber sample, you're applying a stress. The polymers realign and the wiggle unfolds. So the piece deforms and gets longer. The per unit change in length is known as strain, and we can plot this on a stress-strain curve. Lots of materials are elastic around low stresses. You stretch it a little and the spacing between atoms changes. But when you remove the force, it goes back to its original shape. But eventually, you hit a stress where there is permanent deformation. That's called the yield point. The material can't go back to the same shape after. And if you keep going, it will fracture. But the stress-strain curve for rubber is a little weird. It starts out stretching very far with very little force. That's the easy part. But then as you keep pulling, the stress shoots up really fast. - So stretch it fast. What do you notice? - It's a little warm, maybe? - It's hot, it's gone up in temperature by 10 degrees. - Yeah, yeah. That section where it gets really hard to pull it any further and it gets hotter, that's right where rubber starts to crystallize. The rubber warms up because as those new bonds form, they release a bit of energy as heat. Then if you keep stretching it, you get to the point where the crystal can no longer hold it when it breaks. But something strange happens if you stop right before that fracture point. Then the rubber bounces back but on a lower curve. - Keep it stretched, keep it stretched and wiggle it around. Now, relax it. Touch your lips, what do you got? - Now it's a much cooler. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah. - So you went for crystallization formula. You stretched it, you crystallized it, that's an exothermic reaction. - Wow, okay. - You then allowed it to cool down to room temperature and the stretch state and you relaxed it and you dissolved the crystals. - That's weird. - How'd you dissolve the crystals? You've gotta take energy from somewhere to dissolve crystals. You cool the rubber band out. - [Derek] The reason the two curves are different is because it takes more energy to align the polymers than it does for the polymers to curl back up. And this energy difference is exactly the heat that's released over a full cycle. We've seen that natural rubber is built using these building blocks but the technical monomer is actually isoprene which looks like this. It's the same atoms but with some groups and bonds moved around. So the technical term for rubber is cis-1,4-polyisoprene. - And we've actually been able to make synthetic cis-1,4-polyisoprene. You can take isoprene and polymerize it. So it should behave exactly like natural rubber, right? - And that one is the closest but it doesn't perform nearly as well because it's not structurally as perfect as natural rubber. - [Derek] See, there are two ways for the monomers to attach. In natural rubber, they attach on the same side, the cis-attachment. - The percentage of cis in the molecular chain that nature can provide is really accurate. It's 99.99%, something of that sort of scale. - [Derek] But with synthetic rubber, it's easy for monomers to attach on the opposite side of the double bond. That's the trans-attachment. But now there's more room for them to lay flat. They don't have that extra wiggle so they stretch less and don't crystallize very well. - And when you make the synthetic equivalent, it's pretty good but it's 98% cis polyisoprene. There is, you know, 1% or 2% it's gonna be trans-polyisoprene. And therefore, isn't susceptible for crystallization and it's not as good and hasn't not the same strengths properties that natural rubber would have. - [Derek] In a tensile test, a synthetic rubber also stretched to around 600% before breaking. But it only took around 9.1 megapascals compared to over 14.1 megapascals for natural rubber. But there are a few areas where a synthetic rubber is actually better than natural. Under low stress, where crystallization doesn't happen, natural rubber loses the advantage. So synthetic is preferred for the tread of passenger car tires for better abrasion resistance. Nitrile rubber, a synthetic rubber used for gloves, also blocks harsher chemicals from passing through. - So in polyisoprene, we used to see, let's say in chemotherapy agents, maybe 80%-90% permeation. In nitrile, we see maybe 10 - 20. - Wow. - So it's much better. - That's huge. - Mm, that's huge. For a cancer center worker, that's huge. - Nitrile gloves were developed in the late 1980s during the global AIDS pandemic in response to the growing latex allergy. Surprisingly, gloves weren't required for every single procedure until the CDC published a mandate to prevent HIV transmission in 1987. After the demand for gloves went from 300 million to over 36 billion by the end of the 1980s. Well, dozens of new latex glove factories sprang up to meet the demands. Typically, after a mold is dipped in latex, the glove is leached and lots of proteins from the tree are just washed away. But then, they got rid of that step. - This meant that all of those soluble proteins were left in the glove. - So when nurses or doctors were putting on or taking off these unleached powdered gloves, they would disperse all of those proteins into the air. - This nursing staff were breathing those particles in, breathing that dust in, through their entire shifts and into their lungs. Now the patients, you've got these gloves with loads of proteins, washing that around in your innards. - Thousands of people were exposed enough to become allergic to latex. - In the early 90s, you said if you had four surgical procedures, you almost certainly have Type I latex allergy. If you've had 10, you do. - So eventually, manufacturers received enough complaints that they started leaching again, but by then it was too late. Even if something's been properly leached, if someone has that Type I latex allergy, they're still gonna react to it. Nitrile gloves helped combat that allergy. But for long surgeries, some doctors still prefer the softer and more comfortable glove that comes from natural latex. So Dr. Cornish has been working on alternative natural rubber from the Guayule plant which doesn't have the proteins that people are allergic to. This plant can grow in desert climates and it makes a stronger, softer rubber than even the Brazilian rubber tree. - Not only does scaling up Guayule help with the latex allergy, it's also a safeguard in case the blight ever makes its way across to Southeast Asia. Transportation, healthcare, construction, there are so many industries that are dependent on natural rubber. - [Derek] There are regulations around South American leaf blight control and it's difficult to get a direct flight from Brazil to Southeast Asia but not impossible. - It seems shortsighted to leave the industry vulnerable to like one bad flight. For a material that only became useful around 200 years ago, it's now hard to imagine life without it. When Henry Ford developed Fordlandia," he didn't consult a single rubber tree expert who could have told him about the blight. So let's not make that same mistake again.

AGglJehON5g,The Perfect Battery Material Is Dangerous,,Educational,"- This is what the inside of a lithium-ion battery looks like. It's not exactly high tech, just two meters of foil coated in black paste, all packed into this tiny 45 gram cylinder. But these are some of the best batteries we have. They power everything from laptops and electric vehicles to orbiting satellites. Yet when a battery fails, all that energy can get released in the wrong way. - Oh my God. - [Reporter] The latest incident involving a lithium-ion battery. - So how did something so rudimentary looking end up in almost every electronic device on the planet? And why don't we have anything better? In the early 1980s, most rechargeable batteries were stuck at just 40 to 60 watt hours per kilogram, meaning you would need a kilogram of battery to power a 40 watt light bulb for just an hour. As a result, when the first commercial mobile phone launched in 1983, it was pretty unimpressive. It took 10 hours to charge for just 30 minutes of talk time. Laptops, cameras, even medical devices all suffered from the same bulky batteries. Everyone from electronics giants to oil companies were trying to make a better battery, because they knew that even just doubling the energy density could unlock a new era of portable electronics and power the digital revolution. But what no one realized is that someone had already found the solution. In 1972, a 32-year-old British chemist named Stanley Whittingham was studying how different materials store energy at Exxon's research lab in New Jersey. Yes, that Exxon, the multinational oil giant, then the largest oil company in the world. They were researching batteries. The next year, war broke out between Egypt, Syria, and Israel. When the US backed Israel, Arab oil producers cut off oil exports in retaliation. And on December 22nd, the price of crude oil more than doubled from $5.12 a barrel to 11.65. In response, President Nixon created policies to try to keep oil prices down, but they backfired and the shortage only got worse. Americans were left queuing for hours at gas stations as the government introduced a rationing program. It got so bad that they even dropped the national speed limit to 55 miles per hour just to cut consumption. At Exxon, executives were worried that supplies would run out entirely, so they started looking seriously at alternatives, like electricity. This wasn't a new idea. In fact, in 1900 when cars were first taking off, the top selling car was electric, ahead of steam and gas powered cars. But the problem with these electric cars was their batteries. They weighed 360 kilograms, around 40% of the car's weight, but they could only take you around 60 kilometers. And the energy density wasn't just low, it also degraded over time. Every time you recharged, it got worse. After fewer than 500 charges, your range would've dropped to about 40 kilometers. So by 1924, gas powered cars outnumbered electric 10,000 to one. But now that the oil supplies were running out, it seemed to Exxon that there was no other solution than to bring back the electric car, and to do that, they needed a battery with a much higher energy density. So suddenly, Whittingham's side project became a top priority. Exxon poured in resources, giving him free rein to, in his words, ""Do pretty much what I wanted, as long as it did not involve petroleum."" The very first battery dates back to a curious incident in the 1780s when Italian scientist Luigi Galvani was dissecting a frog to study its anatomy. He anchored one side of the frog on a brass hook and went to cut it open with a steel scalpel. But when he touched the scalpel to the frog's leg, he noticed it suddenly twitched, as if it had come back to life. Galvani believed he'd discovered a sort of animal electricity, a living force produced by the tissue itself. But Galvani's rival Alessandro Volta disagreed. He thought it came from the metals themselves. And you can see this with lots of different materials. Veritasium producer Gregor set up a version of this experiment, minus the frog, to test it out. - [Gregor] I have zinc, magnesium, and iron here. I can take any of these metals, stick them into one side of a lemon and stick some copper on the other side. If I hook these up to a volt meter, I should be getting a voltage. And we got around 0.8 volts. Now, the reason this happens is because some elements want to get rid of their electrons more than others. So if you pair one that really doesn't want its electrons with one that really wants some, well, then the electrons are gonna be traveling across. - [Narrator] Let's look at the zinc. What's happening here is that zinc is losing its electrons. The zinc ions enter the juice, and the electrons are forced to go through the circuit to get to the other side. There, hydrogen ions in the lemon juice want those electrons, so they receive them and turn into hydrogen gas. You've got one side that gives up electrons, that's the anode, and you've got one that receives them, that's the cathode. - But why do you need the lemon at all? If there's no flow of the positive ions through to the other side, the electrons stop moving almost immediately. This happens because all of the electrons now get bunched up in the copper, making it extremely negatively charged, and that is just gonna push away any more electrons from coming over to the other side. - [Derek] That's because electrons can't travel through lemon juice. Liquids like this don't have free electrons the way metals do, so electrons stay in the wire. They'll only leave the circuit at the copper side if there's something in the juice, like hydrogen ions ready to take them, and if the reaction releases enough energy to make that transfer happen. But positive ions in the juice can move. They travel across to balance the charge, allowing the current to keep flowing. A solution that carries charge this way by moving ions is called an electrolyte. - But we could also do this with the other metals to get a similar reaction, and we can actually quantify how much each of these metals wants or doesn't want electrons. With zinc, we already got around 0.9 volts, but if you try it with iron, for example, you get something lower, 0.5 or 0.6 volts. Now, magnesium is tricky and it would be a bit higher, but it oxidizes so quickly that even if I scrape some of the oxide from the surface, I'm still getting only around 0.7 volts. The idea is that the larger the voltage on the volt meter, the more energy each electron has to give as it passes through the circuit. But there's also a limit to this. See, this beaker is full of lemon juice from the lemons we used earlier, and they're hooked up using spoons and these wires to a variable power source. Now look what happens when I up the voltage. You'll actually start to see bubbles forming on both spoons, and that's water in the lemon juice actually being broken down into oxygen and hydrogen gas. This already starts happening at 1.23 volts, and that sets a limit on how much voltage you can push through this electrolyte. - Up until the early 1970s, just about every commercial battery used a water-based electrolyte, and as a result, none of these battery cells could push much beyond the 1.23 volt limit. Now, the total energy a battery can store depends on how much energy each charge has to give times how much charge can move, that is the battery's voltage times its capacity. So if you can't increase the voltage, your only option is to make more battery, more cells or bigger cells, but that won't increase the energy density. And this is exactly the problem Whittingham was trying to solve. He was searching for materials that could store large amounts of energy in a compact space with light weight. That led him to a class of compounds called transition metal dichalcogenides. He zeroed in on one in particular, titanium disulfide. Titanium in this compound has effectively lost four electrons, two to each sulfur atom, meaning it sits at a plus four oxidation state. That leaves it very electron hungry, exactly what you want in a battery cathode. But titanium disulfide has a second key advantage, this material is made of stacked layers held together by weak Van der Waals forces. This creates natural gaps between sheets of titanium and sulfur atoms just wide enough to let certain ions slip between the layers, a process known as intercalation. Better still, the structure can expand and contract repeatedly without breaking down. Now Whittingham just had to decide which ions to use. He initially looked at potassium, but it was just too reactive and far too dangerous to work with. Oh, yeah! (laughs) - He turned to this, a soft, silvery metal called lithium. What makes lithium unique is not the fact that it has one electron in its outer shell that it wants to get rid of. No, that it shares with the other elements in its group. What sets it apart is how much energy you can get out of lithium when it reacts in a battery. See, when it loses that outer electron, it forms a tiny, incredibly stable positive ion, and so that reaction paired with the right cathode releases more energy per electron than any other metal. That's why it produces the highest voltage of any metal used in batteries. And because it's so small with just three protons, lithium is also the least dense metal, at just 0.53 grams per cubic centimeter. This combination of low density and the tendency to give away its electron made lithium perfect for Whittingham's vision of this high energy density battery. But while lithium was easier to work with than potassium, easier still didn't mean easy. I mean, they only let me hold it in this glove box, and matter of fact, here's what happens to lithium if you put it in a glass of water. (water bubbles) (tense music) Safe to say, you don't want this happening inside your battery. - So, Whittingham had to switch out the water-based electrolyte for something else, and that change unlocked the possibility of higher voltages. He turned to a solution of lithium salt in an organic solvent, and it worked, but it came with serious risks. The solvent was volatile, the lithium salt was chemically unstable. Together, they formed a mixture that could explode or release toxic fumes if mishandled. Everything had to be done with extreme caution. A stray spark or a trace of moisture could destroy the experiment or start a fire. But if you could get around the danger, this new electrolyte was a huge perk. It let lithium-ions shuttle between electrodes without breaking down the solvent or the cell, at least not until much higher voltages. Whittingham had unlocked lithium's potential, and in the process, he'd broken through the 1.23 volt ceiling. His new chemistry delivered nearly double, a huge 2.4 volts per cell. He now had a working prototype, a metallic lithium anode on one side, a titanium disulfide cathode on the other, his new liquid electrolyte in between. There was also a thin porous separator that kept the electrodes apart, so they couldn't touch and short circuit. Here's how it works. When you close the circuit, lithium atoms at the anode give up their electrons. Those electrons travel through the external circuit toward the cathode, generating a current that powers whatever's connected. At the same time, the lithium-ions are released into the electrolyte, and then they pass through the porous separator and migrate toward the cathode. The electrons arriving through the circuit are taken up by the titanium atoms and the titanium disulfide. The positive lithium-ions slide between the layers to balance out the negative charge of the electrons, and they become locked in place. And this process is reversible. When you apply a voltage to recharge, the extra electrons are stripped from the titanium and pulled back to the anode. The lithium-ions are forced out of the titanium disulfide layers into the electrolyte, and they too migrate to the anode where metallic lithium reforms. What Whittingham had created here was a rechargeable battery, one that worked reliably cycle after cycle with incredible consistency. I don't normally think about batteries this way, but what they really are is tiny little contained chemical reactions. And in a chemical reaction, if you could get a 60% yield, that would be considered good. But in a battery, especially one that you wanna recharge 1000 times, you need that reaction to be say 99.9% efficient, because if it's not, the capacity of that battery rapidly deteriorates. If you have, say, a 95% yield, then you'd lose a significant fraction of lithium-ions every cycle. After just 50 cycles, you'd only have 8% of your original capacity left. So that's pretty incredible that every single lithium-ion has to leave one electrode, pass through the electrolyte, and slot neatly into the layered crystal structure of titanium disulfide. And then when you recharge it, they have to leave again cleanly without incident, without getting stuck, make their way all the way back to the anode. Amazingly, despite just being an early prototype, Whittingham's battery came close to that 99%. In the winter of 1973, Exxon's managers summoned Whittingham to the company's New York office. Whittingham later said, ""I went in there and explained it, five minutes, 10 minutes at the most, and within a week they said yes, they wanted to invest in this."" They got to work at the Exxon laboratory, but it wasn't all smooth sailing. Firefighters had to be called out repeatedly. They were called so often, they threatened to start charging the lab for the special chemicals needed to extinguish the burning lithium. - The problem was the anode. Whittingham's design used pure lithium, which worked brilliantly, until it didn't. - [Billy] We've made a special cell. We've made a transparent battery. - [Gregor] That's so cool. - But they're very, very small, so we have a microscope lens just to allow us to see it. What you're seeing here is a piece of copper, which we're gradually plating with lithium. So this is analogous to the first generation lithium metal batteries, which use lithium metal as the anode. On this side, we have a piece of lithium. As we charge the battery, we're stripping the lithium from that electrode and we're plating it. And actually what's happening right now is the ideal reaction where it's very slow. We're getting a dense plate. The challenge then becomes if we go too fast. - [Gregor] Oh, that is huge! - Everything's fine until all of a sudden it's not fine. So we want the lithium to plate evenly across everywhere, but instead, it forms in that one location, and that is what is a lithium dendrite. That lithium dendrite can grow. The length scales of this is on the order of, you know, millimeters, so that would've easily short circuited the battery. - [Gregor] And that dendrite can just keep growing, and eventually it's gonna poke through the separator and reach to the other side. Now the electrons are gonna have a shortcut, so instead of going through the circuit, they race straight from the anode to the cathode using the dendrite, and that sudden surge of electrons cause intense heating, and that can trigger a chain reaction inside the battery, leading to a fire, or even an explosion. - For all its promise, Whittingham's battery was just too dangerous, and then the oil crisis ended. Prices dropped and Exxon's urgency evaporated. The company shut down its lithium battery program. Whittingham published his design in 1976, and Exxon licensed the patent to a few manufacturers, but with no funding and no momentum, the first lithium battery revolution died before it had a chance to take off. Fortunately, a copy of Whittingham's paper made it across the Atlantic to Oxford University in England, where it caught the attention of John B. Goodenough, an American physicist leading a solid state chemistry group. As he read the paper, one thing stood out, the cell voltage was being held back. The material Whittingham chose for the cathode, titanium disulfide, capped the cell at just 2.4 volts, but Goodenough believed that with a better cathode material, he could do better. He had previously worked with compounds called transition metal oxides. They were more stable than sulfides, and some he knew were extremely hungry for electrons, perfect for a cathode. He tried one of these compounds in his battery, and the voltage immediately spiked from 2.4 volts to four volts. This jump was incredible. But what was even more surprising was the fact that this compound already had lithium in it. The material was lithium cobalt oxide. Lithium cobalt oxide is arranged so that the cobalt and oxygen atoms form tightly bonded layers, with lithium-ions nestled in between. This means that your supply of lithium-ions doesn't just have to come from the dangerous lithium metal on the anode side, it's already there prebuilt into the cathode. So theoretically, you don't even need lithium metal at all. You could assemble the cell in a discharged state with all your lithium-ions in the cathode, then when you connect it to a charger, these ions will get expelled from the cathode crystal lattice and into the electrolyte. At the same time, nearby cobalt atoms will give up an electron to balance out the charge, and those electrons then go through the wire to the anode to meet with the ions. If Goodenough could find an anode that would replace lithium metal, the battery would become safe enough to leave the lab and actually power real world devices. Goodenough was so excited about the potential of his design that he reached out to battery companies across the US, the UK and Europe, but incredibly, no one was interested. So he asked Oxford to file a patent, but they refused. So he took it to a government lab near Oxford, the Atomic Energy Research Establishment, and finally, they agreed to fund the patent, but only if Goodenough signed away his financial rights. Seeing no other option, he agreed, and the lab patented the invention in 1981. Now, this should have been a gold mine, but the lab didn't realize what they had. And so for the second time, the lithium battery revolution was boxed up and shelved. This should have been a turning point for battery science, but bureaucracy and inertia stalled progress. Every field has its bottlenecks. For batteries, it was slow moving institutions. For developers today, it's slow moving code reviews. And I can relate. When we make these videos, especially the ones with simulations or complex animations, it's rarely the ideas that slow us down, it is the reviews. Developers face the same thing. They're writing code faster than ever, thanks to tools like Copilot and Cursor. But code reviews, well, they're still manual and still slow. That's where this video's sponsor CodeRabbit comes in. CodeRabbit automates code reviews with generative AI. Unlike basic tools, it understands your code base, your architecture, standards, even naming conventions. It pulls context from over 40 sources to give feedback that feels precise and human and tailored to your team, right in the Git workflow. That's why it catches what other tools miss, logic errors, bad conditions, math mistakes, even security vulnerabilities, like SQL injections. The result? Well, your senior engineers spend less time buried in reviews and more time solving the problems that only humans can solve. Try it out at CodeRabbit.link/veritasium to cut code review time and bugs in half. And if you're working on open source projects, it's completely free. That's CodeRabbit.link/veritasium. I would like to thank CodeRabbit for sponsoring this part of the video. And now back to Goodenough's design, a breakthrough with nowhere to go, yet. While Goodenough's battery design was gathering dust, 10,000 kilometers away in Japan, a 34-year-old chemist named Akira Yoshino was trying to find a safer battery anode, one that didn't require lithium metal. Yoshino was actually looking at plastic. Now, normally plastic is an insulator, but the kind Yoshino was looking at is different. It's called polyacetylene, and its carbon atoms are arranged in a repeating chain of single and double bonds, a structure that gives it unusual electronic properties. If you tweak polyacetylene by adding or removing electrons, electrons can actually move along this carbon chain. So the plastic conducts electricity like a metal. And that got Yoshino thinking, what if polyacetylene could work as a battery anode? During charging, it could absorb lithium-ions and electrons, and then during discharge, it would give up those electrons to the circuit, just like lithium metal does. If it worked, it could eliminate the most dangerous part of the battery, the metallic lithium. But for months, Yoshino struggled. Obviously, since he removed lithium metal from the anode, he had to get lithium-ions from somewhere else and he couldn't figure it out. And then just as he was losing hope, on the last workday of 1982 while cleaning out his office, he stumbled upon a 1980 paper by John B. Goodenough. It described a cathode made of lithium cobalt oxide, a cathode that already contained lithium. This was the missing piece. He sketched out the reaction between lithium cobalt oxide and his lithium free anode, and then built a test cell using the two materials. It worked safely and reliably, but Yoshino wasn't satisfied. The material he used for the anode, the polyacetylene had an extremely low density. I mean, it couldn't pack in enough lithium, so the energy density of the battery was terrible. Yoshino needed something more lightweight, compact, conductive, and crucially, something that could reversibly accept and release lithium-ions within its structure without breaking down. He tested material after material, and every single one failed, until a breakthrough came from within his own company. Another team had developed a new form of carbon with a unique crystalline structure. They called it vapor grown carbon fiber. He got his hands on a sample, tried it in the lab, and it worked. To prove it, he placed a test cell containing metallic lithium into a safety rig, one that's designed to test explosives. Then he dropped a heavy iron rod onto it. It exploded violently. Then he ran the same test again, but this time with his new design, using carbon as the anode. He charged the cell, placed it in the rig, and dropped the rod but nothing happened. The contrast was undeniable. Later, Yoshino would say, ""That was the moment when the lithium-ion battery was born."" But his employer, Asahi Chemical, well, they weren't a battery company, and they didn't know how to make batteries. So in 1986, Asahi executive Isao Kuribayashi flew to Boston on a top secret mission, carrying three jars containing cathode, anode and electrolyte materials. He handed them to a tiny firm called Battery Engineering, working out of a converted truck garage, and he asked them to turn the materials into cylindrical cells, like the kind you might buy for a flashlight. The team did just that, completely unaware of what they were handling. It wasn't until 2020 that employees learned the truth that they had helped assemble the world's first pre-production lithium-ion batteries. Two weeks later, Kuribayashi returned to Japan with 200 finished perfectly functioning cells. Even then, Asahi's leadership hesitated. Kuribayashi refused to give up. On the 21st of January, 1987, he visited Sony and he took one of the prototype cells and rolled it across the conference table to the Sony execs, and at last, they saw its potential. They reworked the design, swapping out Yoshino's carbon material for graphite that could better intercalate lithium-ions between its layers. And in 1991, Sony launched the first commercial lithium-ion battery inside this, the Sony Handycam. Their battery was compact, rechargeable, powerful, and crucially, free of unstable lithium metal. It was Sony who first coined the name lithium-ion and it stuck. But this wasn't just about one camcorder. Competing companies like Panasonic and Sanyo raced to catch up. Lithium-ion batteries started appearing in phones, CD players, laptops. Manufacturers actually began to advertise the use of lithium-ion batteries as a key selling point of their products. - I'm showing my age here. I joined the industry when lithium-ion cells were first introduced, and there was a Sony camcorder that was introduced, and then there was Dell computer. And I still remember the ads when Dell computer introduced their lithium-ion battery, and they had eight hours of runtime, so they had an advertisement in a magazine and it was eight pages long. Each one was an hour longer, so it was a big deal. - But what's crazy is that even after all this, these batteries should never have worked. See, when you charge the battery for the first time, lithium-ions move from the cathode to the graphite anode. And here, they react with the electrolyte to form this weird complex patchwork of compounds that build up on the anode's surface. These parasitic side reactions should keep going on indefinitely, using up all the lithium and destroying the cell but they don't. Instead they form a thin protective layer known as the solid electrolyte interface, or SEI. It's a kind of chemical shield protecting both the graphite anode and the electrolyte from further reactions. But crucially, lithium-ions can still slip through it. When the SEI originally forms during the first charging cycle, around 5% of the lithium in the cell actually gets stuck in this layer, decreasing the battery's capacity. But this little trade off is what makes the battery stable enough to be used for years or even decades, which is why today lithium-ion batteries are virtually everywhere. From 1991 to 2023, the price per kilowatt hour dropped by 99% from nearly $9,000 to just $100. At the same time, energy density and cycle life, how many times a battery can be charged and discharged before it wears out, improved dramatically, crossing a critical threshold. Lithium-ion batteries had become powerful enough and finally cheap enough for something bigger, the return of the electric car. Today, lithium-ion powers a $100 billion industry. In 2019, Whittingham, Goodenough and Yoshino finally received the Nobel Prize in chemistry for an invention that in the committee's words ""Revolutionized our way of life."" This made Goodenough the oldest Nobel laureate in history, receiving the award at the age of 97. But lithium-ion isn't perfect. - Scary moments aboard a JetBlue plane, a fire erupting after a passenger's backpack suddenly exploded. - Every week, inside an airplane, there is at least one event of a battery, of a phone, of an iPad or a toy or something that catches fire. - What, every week? - Yeah, every week. - It's just the latest incident aboard a plane involving lithium-ion batteries. - [Reporter] So far this year, 60 onboard battery incidents through early October. - Every flight in the US has a bag, a specialized bag with very thick non-flammable materials where you put the phone inside, and you close it, and you still have a hazard and you have to deal with these gases, but now you have put the fire ignition away from anything else. And if it burst into fireworks, then at least it's in a container. And then you tell the captain, ""We need to land immediately."" - [Derek] So what is actually happening when a battery fails like that? - This is a classic lithium-ion battery, and today we're gonna do something I always wanted to do. We're gonna tear one down. I guess safe to say don't do this at home. But what would happen if you were to do this outside of the gloved box? - If you charged up the cell and then you tried to tear it up, then you could accidentally short it, and then it could burn and it could even explode or fire. If you discharged it and you opened it up, you'd release all the different gases and really toxic chemicals, and if you inhale those, then you'd probably end up in hospitals. So at this point, we have what we call the jelly roll. So that's a roll off the cathode, separates that anode. - [Gregor] Yeah. - Stuck together with bit of tape. So Li Ren's just gonna scalpel off the tape, and then we should be able to unroll it into a nice sheet. - [Gregor] So these little patches are the electrolyte or? - Yeah. - Okay. - [Derek S.] So as time goes by, it'll start evaporating out. - That is so cool. It's so obvious when you see it, but I don't think anyone intuitively thinks that it's a rolled up like sheet of anode and cathode inside. But these layers inside the battery, they're not gonna stay perfect forever. Here's an electrode from a new cell compared to one from an old one. You can see that the lithium is building up in all of the wrong places, and if this sort of degradation gets out of hand, well, we're about to push the cell past its breaking point. How do we blow up a battery? - So today we've got a prismatic battery. It's a small battery from sort of a power tool or a phone or something similar. We're gonna wrap it in some nichrome wire, so we pass current through this wire. Something like 200 watts we pass through- - That's a lot. - This wire. Yeah, and it's a significant battery. We want it to go and we want it to go pretty spectacularly. (tense music) (scientists laughing) - [Gregor] Good luck, Harry. What we're simulating here is a catastrophic battery failure, the kind that could happen if a cell is damaged or overheated, or even just badly manufactured. It starts around 80 degrees Celsius when the protective SEI layer on the anode starts to break down. It's gonna try to reform, but these reactions are gonna release more heat, and if that heat can escape, the temperature is gonna keep rising. How close is it to exploding now? What do you think? - It should burst very soon. - Seconds. - [Gregor] At roughly 130 degrees Celsius, the polymer separator is gonna melt, and now the anode and cathode can come into direct contact, and a massive internal short follows. The cathode itself starts to decompose. And because transition metal oxides release oxygen from their crystal structure, they're gonna fuel the combustion, and now the fire is just feeding itself. Oh. - Yes! - Oh, oh my God. (dramatic music) That's really violent. This is insane, from one small battery like that. - And it's only 50% state of charge. - What we call ignition happens inside the battery, not outside the battery, and it requires a fuel or a substance that will undergo a reaction, it requires an oxidizer or the equivalent oxidizer and it requires heat. The battery contains these three inside, so it has its own equivalent to an oxidizer, its own equivalent to a fuel and its own source of heat. - Yeah. - All of it in one device. - So it's not actually lithium that burns. A modern lithium-ion battery like this one here contains very little lithium, ironically. It's actually everything else inside here that's dangerous. It must be really hard putting out a battery fire if it really has everything that it needs. - Yeah, exactly. So you can still put the blanket and stop the oxygen from arriving, but you will not, the fire will not go to zero. It will still, it will be smaller, but it will still be there. And then with water, yeah, water has the ability to take heat away, so it is possible to take the heat away from the battery with water. The best thing is to put and immerse the battery into a bath of water. - Yeah. - It's brutal. You can do it with one battery, with 10 batteries, with 15 batteries, but when you have very large packs of batteries with thousands of batteries, you cannot physically put that under water. - Yeah, one thing that is popping up recently as a threat to cities is electric car fires. - [Guillermo] Well, we know a lot of water works. - Yeah, well, if there's a water source nearby, I guess, yeah. - Yeah, I mean, this is what they do in some countries around the world. They have a truck, a specialist truck full of water, and you just take the car that has been involved in electric fire and they dump it into it. - No way. - Yeah, they do. But, and actually it works. - [Derek] So, how dangerous is it really? - It's very rare. Every million batteries, there is a fire. - Okay. - Right. So that's very safe, that in the standards of engineering, that's like, oh, you have a good system. One out of a million, that's fine. But batteries are everywhere. We don't even think about it. So within our lifetimes, we are going to reach a point where we would have been exposed to more than a million batteries, so we would be all of us experiencing a fire of a battery. - With billions of batteries in circulation, even rare failures become inevitable.

nwhile, demand is skyrocketing. By 2030, we're projected to need over 17 million tons of battery grade materials, and making lithium-ion batteries comes at a cost. Lithium only makes up around 20 parts per million of Earth's crust. It's expensive and water intensive to extract, and 70% of cobalt, another key ingredient in many lithium-ion designs comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo, much of it mined under hazardous, often exploitative conditions. We need more batteries and we need them fast. We can't just rely on lithium alone. - So it's not like lithium's as good as we're gonna get. Like that we're gonna get much better batteries in the future. If our priorities are about saving the planet from runaway climate change, we need to have massive scale energy storage system and electrify almost everything else that we do. - The hunt is still on for safer batteries, for cheaper ones, ones that last longer, charge faster, and ones that store far more energy. The lithium-ion battery changed the world, but the future of energy storage won't be about just conquering one element," it'll be about mastering many.

KZeIEiBrT_w,The Strange Math That Predicts (Almost) Anything,,Educational,"- How many times do you need to shuffle a deck of cards to make them truly random? How much uranium does it take to build a nuclear bomb? (explosion booming) How can you predict the next word in a sentence? And how does Google know which page you're actually searching for? Well, the reason we know the answer to all of these questions is because of a strange math feud in Russia that took place over 100 years ago. In 1905, socialist groups all across Russia rose up against the Tsar, the ruler of the empire. They demanded a complete political reform, or failing that, that he stepped down from power entirely. - This divided the nation into two. So on one side you got the Tsarists, right? They wanted to defend the status quo and keep the Tsar in power. But then on the other side, you had the socialists who wanted this complete political reform. And this division was so bad that it crept into every part of society to the point where even mathematicians started picking sides. - [Derek] On the side of the Tsar was Pavel Nekrasov, unofficially called the Tsar of Probability. Nekrasov was a deeply religious and powerful man, and he used his status to argue that math could be used to explain free will and the will of God. - His intellectual nemesis on the socialist side was Andrey Markov, also known as Andrey The Furious. Markov was an atheist and he had no patience for people who were being unrigorous, something he considered Nekrasov to be, because in his eyes, math had nothing to do with free will or religion. So he publicly criticized Nekrasov's work, listing it among ""the abuses of mathematics."" Their feud centered on the main idea people had used to do probability for the last 200 years. And we can illustrate this with a simple coin flip. When I flip the coin 10 times, I get six times heads and four times tails, which is obviously not the 50/50 you'd expect. But if I keep flipping the coin, then at first the ratio jumps all over the place. But after a large number of flips, we see that it slowly settles down and approaches 50/50. And in this case, after 100 flips, we end up on 51 heads and 49 tails, which is almost exactly what you would expect. This behavior that the average outcome gets closer and closer to the expected value as you run more and more independent trials is known as the law of large numbers. It was first proven by Jacob Bernoulli in 1713, and it was the key concept at the heart of probability theory right up until Markov and Nekrasov. But Bernoulli only proved that it worked for independent events like a fair coin flip, or when you ask people to guess how much they think an item is worth, where one event doesn't influence the others. But now imagine that instead of asking each person to submit their guess individually, you ask people to shout out their answer in public. Well, in this case, the first person might think it's an extraordinarily valuable item, and say it's worth around $2,000, but now all the other people in the room are influenced by this value, and so, their guesses have become dependent. And now the average doesn't converge to the true value, but instead it clusters around a higher amount. - And so, for 200 years, probability had relied on this key assumption, that you need independence to observe the law of large numbers. And this was the idea that sparked Nekrasov and Markov's feud. See, Nekrasov agreed with Bernoulli that you need independence to get the law of large numbers. But he took it one step further. He said, if you see the law of large numbers, you can infer that the underlying events must be independent. - Take this table of Belgian marriages from 1841 to 1845. Now you see that every year the average is about 29,000. And so, it seems like the values converge and therefore that they follow the law of large numbers. And when Nekrasov looked at other social statistics like crime rates and birth rates, he noticed a similar pattern. But now think about where all this data is coming from. It's coming from decisions to get married, decisions to commit crimes, and decisions to have babies, at least for the most part. So Nekrasov reasoned that because these statistics followed the law of large numbers, the decisions causing them must be independent. In other words, he argued that they must be acts of free will. So to him, free will wasn't just something philosophical, it was something you could measure. It was scientific. - [Derek] But to Markov, Nekrasov was delusional. He thought it was absurd to link mathematical independence to free will. So Markov set out to prove that dependent events could also follow the law of large numbers, and that you can still do probability with dependent events. - To do this, he needed something where one event clearly depended on what came before, and he got the idea that this is what happens in text. Whether your next letter is a consonant or a vowel depends heavily on what the current letter is. So to test this, Markov turned to a poem at the heart of Russian literature, ""Eugene Onegin"" by Alexander Pushkin. - He took the first 20,000 letters of the poem, stripped out all punctuation and spaces, and pushed them together into one long string of characters. He counted the letters and found that 43% were vowels and 57% were consonants. Then Markov broke the string into overlapping pairs, that gave him four possible combinations, vowel-vowel, consonant-consonant, vowel-consonant, or consonant-vowel. Now, if the letters were independent, the probability of a vowel-vowel pair would just be the probability of a vowel twice, which is about 0.18 or an 18% chance. But when Markov actually counted, he found vowel-vowel pairs only show up 6% of the time, way less than if they were independent. And when he checked the other pairs, he found that all actual values differed greatly from what the independent case would predict. So Markov had shown that the letters were dependent. And to beat Nekrasov, all he needed to do now was show that these letters still followed the law of large numbers. So he created a prediction machine of sorts. He started by drawing two circles, one for a vowel and one for a consonant. These were his states. Now, say you're at a vowel, then the next letter could either be a vowel or a consonant. So he drew two arrows to represent these transitions. But what are these transition probabilities? Well, Markov knew that if you pick a random starting point, there is a 43% chance that it'll be a vowel. He also knew that vowel-vowel pairs occur about 6% of the time. So to find the probability of going from a vowel to another vowel, he divided 0.06 by 0.43 to find a transition probability of about 13%. And since there is a 100% chance that another letter comes next, all the arrows going from the same state need to add up to one. So the chance of going to a consonant is one minus 0.13, or 87%. He repeated this process for the consonants to complete his predictive machine. So let's see how it works. We'll start at a vowel. Next, we generate a random number between zero and one. If it's below 0.13, we get another vowel, if it's above, we get a consonant. We got 0.78, so we get a consonant, then we generate another number, and check if it's above or below 0.67, 0.21, so we get a vowel. Now, we can keep doing this and keep track of the ratio of vowels to consonants. At first, the ratio jumps all over the place, but after a while, it converges to a steady value, 43% vowels and 57% consonants, the exact split Markov had counted by hand. So Markov had built a dependent system, a literal chain of events, and he showed that it still followed the law of large numbers, which meant that observing convergence in social statistics didn't prove that the underlying decisions were independent. In other words, those statistics don't prove free will at all. Markov had shattered Nekrasov's argument, and he knew it. So he ended his paper with one final dig at his rival. ""Thus, free will is not necessary to do probability."" In fact, independence isn't even necessary to do probability. With this Markov chain, as it came to be known, he found a way to do probability with dependent events. This should have been a huge breakthrough, because in the real world, almost everything is dependent on something else. I mean, the weather tomorrow depends on the conditions today. How a disease spreads depends on who's infected right now, and the behavior of particles depends on the behavior of particles around them. Many of these processes could be modeled using Markov chains. Do people think it was like a mic drop moment and like, ""Oh, Nekrasov's out, like, Markov's the man""? Or people didn't really notice, or it was obscure, or? - I feel like people didn't really notice, like, it wasn't a really big thing. And Markov himself seemingly didn't care much about how it might be applied to practical events. He wrote, ""I'm concerned only with questions of pure analysis. I refer to the question of the applicability with indifference."" Little did he know that this new form of probability theory would soon play a major role in one of the most important developments of the 20th century. On the morning of the 16th of July, 1945, the United States detonated The Gadget, the world's first nuclear bomb. The six kilogram plutonium bomb created an explosion that was equivalent to nearly 25,000 tons of TNT. This was the culmination of the top secret Manhattan Project, a three-year long effort by some of the smartest people alive, including people like J. Robert Oppenheimer, John von Neumann, and a little known mathematician named Stanislaw Ulam. - [Derek] Even after the war ended, Ulam continued trying to figure out how neutrons behave inside a nuclear bomb. Now, a nuclear bomb works something like this. Say you have a core of uranium-235, then when a neutron hits a U-235 nucleus, the nucleus splits releasing energy and, crucially, two or three more neutrons. If, on average, those new neutrons go on to hit and split more than one other U-235 nucleus, you get a runaway chain reaction, so you have a nuclear bomb. But uranium-235, the fissile fuel needed for the bombs was really hard to get. So one of the key questions was just how much of it do you need to build a bomb? And this is why Ulam wanted to understand how the neutrons behave. - [Casper] But then in January of 1946, everything came to a halt. Ulam was struck by a sudden and severe case of encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain, that nearly killed him. His recovery was long and slow, with Ulam spending most of his time in beds. To pass the time, he played a simple card game, Solitaire. But as he played countless games, winning some, losing others, one question kept nagging at him, what are the chances that a randomly-shuffled game of Solitaire could be won? It was a deceivingly difficult problem to solve. Ulam played with all 52 cards where each arrangement created a unique game, so the total number of possible games was 52 factorial, or about eight times 10 to 67. So solving this analytically was hopeless. But then Ulam had a flash of insight, what if I just play hundreds of games and count how many could be won? That would give him some sort of statistical approximation of the answer. Back at Los Alamos, the remaining scientists grappled with much harder problems than Solitaire, like figuring out how neutrons behave inside a nuclear core. In a nuclear core, there are trillions and trillions of neutrons all interacting with their surroundings. So the number of possible outcomes is immense, and computing it directly seemed impossible. - [Derek] But when Ulam returned to work, he had a sudden revelation. What if we could simulate these systems by generating lots of random outcomes like I did with Solitaire? He shared this idea with von Neumann, who immediately recognized its power, but also spotted a key problem. - See, in Solitaire, each game is independent. How the cards are dealt in one game have no effect on the next, but neutrons aren't like that. A neutron's behavior depends on where it is and what it has done before. So you couldn't just sample random outcomes like in Solitaire. Instead, you needed to model a whole chain of events where each step influenced the next. What von Neumann realized is that you needed a Markov chain. So they made one and a much simplified version of it works something like this. Now, the starting state is just a neutron traveling through the core, and from there, three things can happen. It can scatter off an atom and keep traveling, so that gives you an arrow going back to itself. It can leave the system or get absorbed by a non-fissile material, in which case it no longer takes part in the chain reaction, and so it ends its Markov chain, or it can strike another uranium-235 atom, triggering a fission event and releasing two or three more neutrons that then start their own chains. But in this chain, the transition probabilities aren't fixed, they depend on things like the neutron's position, velocity and energy, as well as the overall configuration and mass of uranium. So a fast-moving neutron might have a 30% chance to scatter, a 50% chance to be absorbed or leave, and a 20% chance to cause fission. But a slower-moving neutron would have different probabilities. Next, they ran this chain on the world's first electronic computer, the ENIAC. The computer started by randomly generating a neutron starting conditions and stepped through the chain to keep track of how many neutrons were produced on average per run, known as the multiplication factor k. So if, on average, one neutron produces another two neutrons, then k is equal to two. And if on average every two neutrons produce three neutrons, then k is equal to three over two, and so on. Then, after stepping through the full chain for a specified number of steps, we collect the average k-value and record that number in a histogram. This process was then repeated hundreds of times, and the results tallied up, giving you a statistical distribution of the outcome. If you find that in most cases, k is less than one, the reaction dies down. If it's equal to one, there's a self-sustaining chain reaction, but it doesn't grow. And if k is larger than one, the reaction grows exponentially and you've got a bomb. - With it, von Neumann and Ulam had a statistical way to figure out how many neutrons were produced without having to do any exact calculations. In other words, they could approximate differential equations that were too hard to solve analytically. All that was needed was a name for the new method. Now, Ulam's uncle was a gambler, and the random sampling and high stakes reminded Ulam of the Monte Carlo Casino in Monaco, and the name stuck. The  Monte Carlo method was born. The method was so successful that it didn't stay secret for long. By the end of 1948, scientists at another lab, Argonne, in Chicago, used it to study nuclear reactor designs, and from there, the idea spread quickly. Ulam later remarked, ""It is still an unending source of surprise for me to see how a few scribbles on a blackboard could change the course of human affairs."" And it wouldn't be the last time Markov chain based method changed the course of human affairs. (upbeat music) - In 1993, the internet was open to the public, and soon it exploded. By the mid-1990s, thousands of new pages appeared every day, and that number was only growing. This created a new kind of problem. I mean, how do you find anything in this ever-expending sea of information? In 1994, two Stanford PhD students, Jerry Yang and David Filo, founded the search engine Yahoo, to address this issue, but they needed money. So a year later, they arranged to meet with Japanese billionaire, Masayoshi Son, also known as the Bill Gates of Japan. (gong clangs) - They were looking to raise $5 million for their next startup, but Son has other plans. He offers to invest a full $100 million instead. That's 20 times more than what the founders asked for. So Jerry Yang declines saying, ""We don't need that much,"" but Son disagrees, ""Jerry, everyone needs $100 million."" (Son laughs) Before the founders get a chance to respond, Son jumps in again and asks, ""Who are your biggest competitors?"" ""Excite and lycos,"" the pair respond. Son orders his associate to write those names down. And then he says, ""If you don't let me invest in Yahoo, I will invest in one of them and I'll kill you."" See, Son had realized something. None of the leading search engines at the time had any superior technology. They didn't have a technological advantage over the others. They all just ranked pages by how often a search term appears on a given page. So the battle for the number one search engine would be decided by who could attract the most users, who could spend the most on marketing. - [Announcer 1] Lycos, go get it. - [Announcer 2] Get Lycos, or get lost. - [Announcer 3] This is revolution. (upbeat funky music) ♪ Yahoo ♪ - [Derek] And marketing required a lot of money, money that Son had, so he could decide who won the war. Yahoo's founders realized they were left with no real choice but to accept Son's investment. - [Speaker] So here we are, right in the middle of Yahoo. - [Derek] And within four years, Yahoo became the most popular site on the planet. - [Reporter] In the time it takes to say this sentence, Yahoo will answer 79,000 information requests worldwide, the two men are now worth $120 million each. ♪ Yahoo ♪ - But Yahoo had a critical weakness. See, Yahoo's keyword search was easy to trick. To get your page ranked highly, you could just repeat keywords hundreds of times, hidden with white text on a white background. - One thing they didn't have in those early days was a notion of quality of the result. So they had a notion of relevance saying, does this document talk about the thing that you're interested in? But there wasn't really a notion of which ones are better. - What they really needed was a way to rank pages by both relevance and quality. But how do you measure the quality of a webpage? Well, to understand that, we need to borrow an idea from libraries. - So I'm old enough that library books used to have a paper card in it that was a stamp of all the due dates of when it was due back. You took a book and if it had a lot of those, you said, ""Oh, this is probably a good book."" And if it didn't have any, you said, ""Well, maybe this isn't the best book."" - Stamps acted like endorsements. The more stamps, the better the book must be. And the same idea can be applied to the web. Over at Stanford, two PhD students, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, were working on this exact problem. Brin and Page realized that each link to a page can be thought of as an endorsement. And the more links a page sends out, the less valuable each vote becomes. So what they realized is that we can model the web as a Markov chain. - [Derek] To see how this works, imagine a toy internet with just four webpages. Call them Amy, Ben, Chris, and Dan. These are our states. Typically, one webpage links to others, allowing you to move between them. These are our transitions. In this setup, Amy only links to Ben, so there's a 100% chance of going from Amy to Ben. Ben links to Amy, Chris, and Dan, so there's a 33% chance of going to any of those pages, and we can fill out the other transition probabilities in the same way. So now we can run this Markov chain and see what happens. Imagine you're a surfer on this web. You start on a random page, say, Amy, and you keep running the machine and keep track of the percentage of time you spend on each page. Over time, the ratio settles and the scores give us some measure of the relative importance of these pages. You spend the most time on Ben, so Ben is ranked first, followed by Amy, then Dan, and lastly Chris. It might seem like there's an easy way to beat the system, just make 100 pages all linking to your website. Now you get 100 full votes and you'll always rank on top, but that is not the case. While during their first few steps, they might make your page seem important, none of the other websites link to them. So over many steps, their contributions don't matter. You might have many links, but they're not quality links, so they don't affect the algorithm. - But there is still one problem, though, not all pages are connected. In networks like this one, a random server can get stuck in a loop, never reaching the rest of the web. So to fix this, we can set a rule that 85% of the time, our random server just follows a link like normal. But then for about 15% of the time, they just jump to a page at random. This damping factor makes sure that we explore all possible parts of the web without ever getting stuck. By using Markov chains, Page and Brin had built a better search engine, and they called it PageRank. - Because it's talking about how pages react, webpages react with each other and also 'cause the founder's name is Larry Page, so he snuck that in. - With PageRank, Google got much better search results, often getting you to the site you were looking for in one go. Although, to some, this sounded like a terrible idea. - Others said, ""Oh, well you're telling me you get a search that will get the right result on the first answer? Well, I don't want that because if it takes them three or four chances, searches to get the right answer, then I have three or four chances to show ads, and if you get 'em the answer right away, I'm just gonna lose them. So, you know, I don't see why better search is better."" - But Page and Brin disagreed. They were convinced that if their product was far superior, then people would flock to it. - I would say it actually is a democracy that works. If all pages were equal, anybody can manufacture as many pages as they want. I can set up a billion pages in my server tomorrow. We shouldn't treat them all as equal. Just looking at the data out of curiosity, we found that we had technology to do a better job of search, and we realized how impactful having great search can be. - And so, in 1998, they launched their new search engine to take on Yahoo. Initially, they called it BackRub, after the backlinks it analyzed, but then they realized that maybe that's not the most attractive name. Now, their ambitions were big to essentially index all the pages on the internet, and they needed a name equally as big. So they thought of the largest number they could think of, 10 to the power of 100, a googol. But then when trying to register their domain, they accidentally misspelled it. And so, Google was born. (dramatic music) Over the next four years, Google overthrew Yahoo to become the most used search engine. - Everyone who knows the internet almost certainly knows Google. - Googling is like oxygen to teenagers. - [Casper] And today, Alphabet, which is Google's parent company, is worth around $2 trillion. - When Google makes even the slightest change in its algorithms, it can have huge effects. - Google. - Google. - Google. - Google. - They're on fire. And the reason why they're on fire is because they're focused and they're more focused than Yahoo who does search, they're more focused than Microsoft who does search with Bing. Yahoo has lots of traffic, they always have, they have some really great properties, but I don't think Yahoo is the go-to place, you know. - And at the heart of this trillion dollar algorithm is a Markov chain, which only looks at the current state to predict what's going to happen next. But in the 1940s, Claude Shannon, the father of information theory, started asking a different question. He went back to Markov's original idea of predicting text, but instead of just using vowels and consonants, he focused on individual letters. And he wondered, what if instead of looking at only the last letter as a predictor, I look at the last two? Well, with that, he got text that looked like this. Now, it doesn't make much sense, but there are some recognizable words like ""whey"", ""of"", and ""the"". But Shannon was convinced he could do better. So next, instead of looking at letters, he wondered, what if I use entire words as predictors? That gave him sentences like this, ""The head and in frontal attack on an English writer that the character of this point is therefore another method for the letters that the time of who ever told the problem for an unexpected."" Now, clearly, this doesn't make any sense, but Shannon did notice that sequences of four words or so generally did make sense. For instance, ""attack on an English writer"" kind of makes sense. So Shannon learned that you can make better and better predictions about what the next word is going to be by taking into account more and more of the previous words. It's kind of like what Gmail does when it predicts what you're going to type next. And this is no coincidence, the algorithms that make these predictions are based on Markov chains. - They're not necessarily using letters, you know, -Yeah they use what they call tokens, some of which are letters, some of which are words, marks of punctuation, whatever. So it's a bigger set than just the alphabet. The game is simply, we have this string of tokens that, you know, might be 30 long, and we're asking what are the odds that the next token is this or this or this? - [Derek] But today's large language models don't treat all those tokens equally, because unlike simple Markov chains, they also use something called attention, which tells the model what to pay attention to. So in the phrase, ""the structure of the cell,"" the model can use previous context like blood and mitochondria to know the cell most likely refers to biology rather than a prison cell. And it uses that to tune its prediction. But as large language models become more widespread, one concern is that the text they produce ends up on the internet and that becomes training data for future models. - When you start doing that, the game is very soon over. You come, in this case, to us, a very dull, stable state, it just says the same thing over and over and over again forever. The language models are vulnerable to this process. - And any system like this where we have a feedback loop, will become hard to model using Markov chains. Take global warming, for instance, as we increase the amount of carbon dioxide in the air, the average temperature of the Earth increases. But as the temperature increases, the atmosphere can hold more water vapor, which is an incredibly powerful greenhouse gas. And with more water vapor, the temperature increases further allowing for even more water vapor. So you get this positive feedback loop, which makes it hard to predict what's going to happen next. So there are some systems where Markov chains don't work, but for many other dependent systems, they offer a way of doing probability. - But what's fascinating is that all these systems have extremely long histories. I mean, you could trace back all the letters in a text, trace back all the interactions of what a neutron did, or trace back the weather for weeks. But the beautiful thing Markov and others found is that for many of these systems you can ignore almost all of that. You can just look at the current state and forget about the rest, that makes these systems memoryless. And it's this memoryless property that makes Markov chains so powerful because it's what allows you to take these extremely complex systems and simplify them a lot to still make meaningful predictions. - [Derek] As one paper put it, ""Problem-solving is often a matter of cooking up an appropriate Markov chain."" - It's kind of ridiculous to me that this basic fact of mathematics would come out of a fight like that, which, you know, really had nothing to do with it. But all the evidence suggests that it really was this determination to show up Nekrasov that led Markov to do the work. - But there's one question we still haven't answered. When playing Solitaire, how did Ulam know his cards were perfectly shuffled? I mean, how many shuffles does it take to get a completely random arrangement of cards? - If you have a deck of cards, you need to shuffle it, right? How often, if you're shuffling, like, you know, you split it in half, and then you do the (cards riffling). How often do you have to shuffle it to make it completely random? - Two. - Two? I'm going with 26. - Yeah, four times. - Four times? - I don't know, 52 times? - Okay. Okay. It's not a bad guess. - Seven? - It is seven. - Really? - Yeah. So you can think of card shuffling as a Markov chain where each deck arrangement is a state, and then each shuffle is a step. And so for a deck of 52 cards, if you riffle shuffle it seven times, then every arrangement of the deck is about equally likely, so it's basically random. But I can't shuffle like that. So for me, what I do is I do it like this. How many times do you think you have to shuffle like this to get it random? (beeping) - What do you think? And perhaps more importantly, how would you go about working it out? Well, that's where today's sponsor Brilliant comes in. Brilliant is a learning app that gets you hands-on with problems just like this. Whether it's math, physics, programming, or even AI, Brilliant's interactive lessons and challenges let you play your way to a sharper mind. You can discover how large language models actually work from basic Markov chains to complex neural networks, or dig into the math behind this shuffling question. It's a fun way to build knowledge and skills that help you solve all kinds of problems, which brings us back to our shuffle.

x32Zq-XvID4,The Obviously True Theorem No One Can Prove,Veritasium and fern,Educational,"- [Derek] In Xiamen, China, in the winter of 1954, (fire crackling) air raid sirens (explosions thudding) are sounded all over the city. (siren blaring) People scramble for cover (people screaming) as artillery shells (artillery shells blasting) are being fired in the distance. (artillery shells blasting) The people's Republic of China is bombarding the nearby Kinmen Islands in an attempt to take over control from the anti-communist Chinese. (tank rattling) (boots thudding) But troops on the islands fire back. (artillery shells blasting) Soon, artillery shells are raining down on both sides. (explosion thudding) (siren blaring) (tense music continuing) Back in Xiamen, (siren blaring) Inside one of these shelters is 21-year-old Chen Jingrun. As others are fidgeting impatiently, waiting for the explosions to stop, Chen is reading pages (explosion blasting) from a math book, (pages rustling) because he's on a mission to solve one of the oldest problems in math. (dramatic tense music) - A child can understand the statement, but the greatest geniuses in mathematical history have not been able to solve it. - In the year 2000, a publishing house even offered   a $1 million prize to anyone who could solve the problem. But for nearly 300 years, everyone who has tried (dramatic music building) has failed. So the problem is this, can every even number greater than 2 be written as the sum of two primes? - So that's the problem. So we can do some examples. (pen cap clicking) We can say, for example, 6. You know that's an even integer. So can we write it as the sum of two primes? So those are numbers that only divide by themselves and by 1. So for 6, it's just 3 plus 3, and we can do more and more numbers. So 10, for example, would be, you know, 5 plus 5, but also 7 plus 3. There's one I want to do, one extra, which is your favorite number. - 42. - 42. What makes it up? - 37 and 5. - 37. Yeah. But there's also a, sort of, nicer, more methodical, way of writing this out, and it will help us (paper rustling) build some intuition. - [Casper] We'll start by drawing two diagonal lines. (soft inquisitive music) - I'm building like a pyramid. A pyramid of prime numbers. (pen cap clicking) - [Derek] All right. - [Casper] So, we're gonna start at the top. We're gonna write down 2. Then we'll write down 3. 5. And this is gonna be a good test of how well I know my primes. Then we'll do the same on the other sides. Okay, and now, what we're gonna do is, we're gonna draw a line from each prime. Can you see where this is going? - [Derek] And where they cross is every sum? - [Casper] Yeah. Now I can start adding them. So we get 2 plus 2. - 4. - [Casper] 4. 3 plus 3. - 6. - 6. You can see, we're starting to get all these numbers. The main point here is just, as you go down, not only do you see all the even numbers appear, but they also seem to appear more frequently. And it seems like it should always happen. And, of course, the conjecture is that it does always happen, and that's known as the gold Goldbach's conjecture. - [Derek] Chen's obsession (mysterious gentle music) with the conjecture goes back to his high school years, when his teacher stood in front of the class telling the students all about the sciences, and said, ""Mathematics is the queen of the sciences. Number theory is the queen's crown. And the Goldbach's conjecture is the pearl on the crown."" (soft music continuing) - Shortly after, the teacher said, ""Well, perhaps, one day, one of you kids will solve it."" And then the whole class burst out laughing. (people laughing) Everyone except for Chen Jingrun. (inspiring classical music) He later said, ""I did not laugh. I did not dare to laugh. I was worried my classmates would know my vision, but I never forgot this lesson to always remember the pearl on the crown, and to never forget my aspirations or ideals."" - [Derek] And now, (alarm blaring) as air raid alarms are ringing, he's maintained his vision. (alarm blaring) He's working on his math, trying to solve Goldbach's conjecture. - And then it's like, well, who the hell is Goldbach? (playful classical music) Do you know a Goldbach? - I know nothing about Goldbach. - Christian Goldbach is a little known Prussian mathematician who grew up in the early 1700s. At first, (paper rustling) he mostly studied medicine and law, only occasionally dabbling in mathematics. But then in 1710, at the age of 20, he set off on a 14 year, and over 4,000 kilometer long, journey to meet some of the greatest mathematicians alive. (playful classical music playing) In Leipzig, he met with Gottfried Leibniz, the co-inventor of calculus. And, in London, he met with both Nicolaus Bernoulli, and, perhaps the greatest mathematician of all time, Sir Isaac Newton. (classical music continuing) He then finished this trip around Europe before ultimately settling down in Russia at the newly formed St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. (waves crashing) (seagulls cawing) Where, in 1727, he met his most important connection, a 20-year-old math prodigy. Can you guess who? - Leonard Euler? - Leonard Euler. (both laughing) - The two quickly became friends, bonding over a shared obsession with number theory. Then, in 1729, Goldbach moved to Moscow, but the two stayed in touch, writing letters to each other for the next 35 years, literally until Goldbach died. (tense fast music playing) (wind whooshing) It was in one of these letters, (paper rustling) on the 7th of June, 1742, where Goldbach scribbled a line in the margin. It was not the exact form of the conjecture which now bears his name, but something related. (wind whooshing) ""It seems that every integer greater than 2 can be written as the sum of three primes."" (slow classical music) Euler was intrigued by the proposition, but he thought the idea could be refined further. It made sense to him that odd numbers might need three numbers to add together to make them, but then he turned his attention to even numbers, and he thought, ""Well, with even numbers, perhaps just two prime numbers would be enough to sum to give you every even number."" In fact, as Euler wrote in his letter, this is how Goldbach originally framed the problem in person. So, Euler reformulated Goldbach's idea (wind whooshing) into two separate conjectures. (wind whooshing) The first dealt with odd numbers, and said, ""Every odd number greater than 5 can be written as the sum of three primes."" This became known as the weak Goldbach conjecture. And the second (wind whooshing) dealt with even numbers. It said, ""Every even number greater than 2 can be written as the sum of two primes."" This became known as the strong Goldbach conjecture. (wind whooshing) (playful gentle music) They get their names strong and weak conjecture, because (wind whooshing) if you have the strong conjecture, then you've shown that every even number greater than 2 can be written as the sum of just two primes. And then you can add three (wind whooshing) to each of those sums to get all of the odd numbers. So if you can prove the strong conjecture, you get the weak one for free. But the reverse is not true. If you can prove the weak conjecture, you still don't get the strong one. Now, after Euler reformulated these conjectures, he was so confident they were true, that he wrote, ""I regard this as a completely certain theorem, although I cannot prove it."" - And he couldn't, you know? And for the next 150 years, almost no progress is made. (cymbals crashing) - [Derek] That is until, in 1900, German mathematician David Hilbert addressed the International Congress of Mathematicians, in Paris. (paper rustling) And there, he listed 23 of the most important problems for the 20th century. (pages rustling) Number eight on that list was all about prime numbers, including Goldbach's conjecture. (pen scratching) - Goldbach's conjecture was back on the radar. Only now, mathematicians started to look at the problem differently. (gentle inquisitive music) - [Derek] Let's take a look at our pyramid again. One thing to notice is that this pyramid is symmetrical. When two primes add to make an even number on the right side, those same two primes make an even number on the left side. So, to avoid double counting, we can look only at the right side of this center line. And what we find is that for very small even numbers, like 4, 6, or 8, well, there's only one way to write them as the sum of two primes. But for larger numbers, like 20, well, now there are multiple different ways to write it as the sum of two primes, and the further down you go, the more combinations you find. - So, mathematicians started asking a new question, not just whether every even number can be written as the sum of two primes, but in how many different ways it can be done. - [Derek] Let's call that number H of N. For example, H of 4 is 1, because you can only write 4 as the sum of primes 2 plus 2. H of 20 is 2, because that is 3 plus 17, and 7 plus 13. H of 42 is 4, and so on. (bubble popping) Now, so far, we're just counting up what the value of H should be. But in 1923, two English mathematicians, G. H. Hardy and John Littlewood, tried to come up with a function that would estimate H of N. To do it, they relied on one of the most important results from number theory, the prime number theorem. (harp chiming) (bright classical music) This tells you that, on average, a large number in the neighborhood of N, has 1 over the natural logarithm of N chance of being prime. So here's a crude version of what Hardy and Littlewood did. They imagined this large even number, and they said it equal to 2N. So you could split it right down the middle at N. Now they considered a pair of numbers, A and B, that together add up to 2N. Where A is smaller than N, and B is larger. They both must differ from N by the same amount. Let's call it C. Now, according to the prime number theorem, the chance that A is prime is 1 over the natural algorithm of N - C. And the chance that B is prime is 1 over the natural algorithm of N plus C. But here's the trick. - Most of the times we're talking about Ns that are ginormous, that are super, super large. And if you look at 1 over L and N, that function would be something like this. Where, basically, it drops very quickly at the start. And, for large numbers, it's almost constant. So that this C really doesn't affect it a whole lot. So, for most of the numbers, we can, sort of, ignore the C, in both cases, and it becomes much simpler, which is just the chance of A being prime is about 1 over L and N, and the chance of B being prime is about 1 over L and N. Now, what's the chance that both are prime? - [Derek] You're gonna multiply 'em together, - We're gonna multiply them together - [Derek] Still, so far we've just looked at one pair, while, in total, there are about N possible pairs, N ways to add up two numbers to get to 2N. So we can just multiply the chance of one pair being prime with the total number of pairs, to find the total expected number of prime pairs, which comes out to about N over ln N squared. And if we plot this, we find that the expected number of ways to write any number as the sum of two primes increases for larger and larger numbers. - Hardy and Littlewood, they refined this a bit more, but essentially what they find, you know, is the exact same thing. They just have like a correction factor in front, but then this term is still the same. - [Derek] The only problem is that this is just an estimate, not a proof. And as they point out in their own conclusion, ""It is only proof that counts."" - And that's about as far as they get for the strong Goldbach conjecture. But on the weak one, they have more success. (inquisitive pulsing music) - [Derek] It all comes back to a curious incident 10 years earlier, in 1913. We've invited Elmer, from the YouTube channel, Fern, to tell you about it. (tense inquisitive music) - [Elmer] Hardy sits at his breakfast table, when a strange letter arrives. (inquisitive music continuing) It's sent by a completely unknown mathematician from India, (camera clicking) Srinivasa Ramanujan. The letter reads, ""I'm now about 23 years of age. I have no university education, but I have undergone the ordinary school course. After leaving school, I've been employing the spare time at my disposal to work at mathematics."" Ramanujan writes that he's a poor clerk, earning only about 20 pounds a year. He's attached some formulas and is asking for Hardy's opinion. The letter is over 10 pages long and is packed with over 100 theorems, many of them highly advanced, (clicker clicking) yet Ramanujan provides no proofs and very little explanation. Hardy is astounded. He has never seen anything like it. Some are already known, (clock ticking) others are completely new, (clock ticking) unknown to the world. (clock ticking) And then there are results (clock ticking) that seem impossible. (clock ticking) Like that the sum of all positive integers up to infinity is negative 1 12th. How did he come up with this? (shutter clicking) (inquisitive music continuing) Hardy shows a letter to Littlewood. The two stay up until midnight going through the manuscript, debating whether the mysterious author is a genius or a fraud. - But it sounded like Hardy felt these couldn't be crank results because you couldn't imagine them if you were just a crank. They're too fantastical to be the the work of that kind of second rate mind. Only a really phenomenal, off-the-chart, genius could have come up with them. - [Elmer] So Hardy writes back. The rigorous and strict mathematician he is, he asks for proof. (birds tweeting) Ramanujan, however, is nothing like Hardy. He works on intuition, often guided by dreams. - He would just see the result, or in some mystical versions of his own telling, he would say that his personal goddess, Namagiri, would come to him in his dreams, and write the formulas on his tongue. - Wait on his tongue? - On his tongue is the version I've sometimes heard. But in any case, she planted it in his mind. - [Elmer] ""An equation for me has no meaning unless it expresses a thought of God."" Ramanujan never really learned how to provide proof to his theorems. So Hardy urges him to come to Cambridge to explain them in more detail. But there's a problem. (bird tweeting) Ramanujan is a devout Hindu. His faith forbids him from crossing the sea. Then one night his mother has a dream, (harp trilling) a goddess appears, and tells her to let Ramanujan fulfill his destiny. Convinced by the vision she gives her blessing. (camera clicking) And so, Ramanujan finally sets out for England. (inspiring music playing) In Cambridge, Hardy and Ramanujan start working together. - I mean, I'm gonna get choked up thinking about it. It's such a beautiful sentiment. Trying to remember how Hardy put it. It's something like he thought, (gentle music continuing) you know, on a scale from 0 to 100, you know, maybe he's a 10. Littlewood is a 30. Like Ramanujan is an 80, some kind of crazy thing like that. So he knew that Ramanujan was special. Hmm, didn't expect to get emotional for you, but this is what I do when I think about Ramanujan. (Professor Strogatz laughing) - [Elmer] But his new life in England is harsh. He's not used to the climate, (emotional string music) he's not used to the food, and war is ravaging. It will become one of the darkest chapters of his life. If you wanna know more about Ramanujan's struggles, and what made him such a genius, there's an upcoming video on our channel, Fern. - [Derek] While Ramanujan struggled, Hardy and he did make a breakthrough. (hopeful classical music playing) Around 1917, they invented what's known as the circle method, and used it to tackle different problems in number theory. Hardy and Littlewood later developed this idea further, and for the next a hundred years, this would be the main method to tackle the weak Goldbach conjecture. - But let's remind ourselves of the problem. We're trying to prove that we can always write an odd number, large odd number, as the sum of three primes. Call it P1, P2, and P3. (gentle inquisitive music) - But just like before, we don't only want to know whether it's possible, but in how many different ways it can be done. So, Hardy and Littlewood imagined a counting machine of sorts. As input, it would take all possible combinations of three prime numbers smaller than N. (machine ticking) For each combination it would add them up and check if that sum is equal to N. And, if it is, the machine increments a counter by 1. (bell dinging) But if not, the machine does nothing. (bell dinging) It goes on (machine whirring) to the next combination. (machine whirring) Let's do an example. (machine whirring) Say N is 11. Well, the machine first checks the primes 2, 2, and 2, adds them up to get 6, (machine whirring) which is not equal to 11. So the counter stays at 0. (bell dinging) Next it tries 2, 2, 3, which is 7. So again, it does nothing. (bell dinging) And it keeps cycling through until it hits 2, 2, 7, (bell dinging) which is equal to 11. (machine whirring) So now the machine increments the counter (bell dinging) by 1. As it keeps running through primes, the counter increments only one more time for 3, 3, 5. (bell dinging) (machine whirring) So in total, there are two ways to write 11 (bell dinging) as the sum of three primes. But how would you go about building this machine out of mathematics? (pen scratching) Because that is exactly what Hardy and Littlewood did. Their technique is so ingenious, I want to take you through it step by step. It starts with the function E to the I theta. This function just traces out a unit circle in the complex plane. The angle theta determines how far around the circle you are. Now imagine that theta is restricted to be some multiple M of 2 pi. And since 2 pi is one complete revolution, it doesn't matter if M is 0, 1, 2, 3, or any integer, a vector from the origin would always point in the same direction, to the right. But now Hardy and Littlewood multiply the angle by alpha, where alpha is just some number between 0 and 1. You can think of it as a slider. So if M equals 1, and you increase alpha from 0, well, the vector slowly makes one full rotation. If M equals 2, the vector will move around faster and make two full rotations. And this keeps going for higher values of M. Now imagine taking all possible values of alpha simultaneously, and then averaging out all of those vectors. Mathematically, we can write this as the integral from 0, to 1 of E of the I 2 pi alpha, D alpha. So what happens? Well, this vector cancels with this one on the opposite side, and this one with that one. And the same thing happens with all the vectors. So, averaging them, we get 0. The same thing happens if M equals 2, or 3, or 4. This integral will give 0 for all values of M. Except a single case. If M equals 0, then we have E to the 0 which equals 1. So no matter what alpha is, the vector always points to the right, and averaging that will always give 1. So this equation is very close to the machine we were trying to create. If M equals 0, it returns 1, (bell dinging) but if M is not equal to 0, it returns 0. (bell dinging) So all that's left to do is replace M with what we're interested in. Specifically, is the sum of P1 plus P2 plus P3 equal to N? We can rearrange that to get P1 plus P2 plus P3 minus equals 0. So, if we sub in this expression for M, then every time the three primes add up to N, this value will be 0, and the integral (bell dinging) will be equal to one. And every time the primes don't add up to N, this value will be non-zero. And so the integral will return 0. (bell dinging) But, right now, this equation only checks one triplet of primes. To check all possible combinations of primes smaller than N, we need to add a sum. Since this will count up all the ways three primes can add to make N, we can call it H of N. So in fact, let's try it out. Put in N equals 11, compute this function, and it gives 6. (wind whooshing) (paper rustling) Which is not the 2 we found before. So what happened? Well, we've simplified the logic a little bit, so we actually get some duplicates this time. For example, the machine finds 2, 2, 7, but also 7, 2, 2, and 2, 7, 2. Mathematicians correct for this when doing the real calculation, but for our purposes, this machine is good enough. So we've got our H of N, and if we can show that H of N is at least 1 for every odd number greater than 5, then we've proven the weak Goldbach conjecture. But there are two issues with this approach. The first is that we assumed that we know all of the prime numbers smaller than N, which is true when N is small. But as N goes to infinity, we just don't know all of the primes. The second problem is that, as the number of primes increases, the number of possible combinations explodes. If N is 10,001, there are 1,229 smaller prime numbers, which means a total of 310 million, 144 thousand, 296 possible prime triplets. Increase N to a billion, and the possible combinations jumps up to nearly 22 sextillion. (soft piano music playing) And this trend continues. So, using this approach in a simple way won't work. So Hardy and Littlewood came up with a smarter way. They fundamentally reframed the problem by taking the sum inside the integral. Rather than checking all possible combinations of prime numbers by brute force, they now analyze the collective behavior of all the primes at once. To see how this works, take a look at the equation. In the exponent is the sum of three primes minus N, but adding in the exponent is the same as multiplying exponentials together. So we can rewrite this as the product of four exponentials. The first three of these are actually identical because there's nothing to distinguish what we call P1, P2, P3. They're all prime numbers drawn from the same set. So we could just call this function S of alpha and N, and we could multiply it by itself three times, or just cube it. By doing this, H of N is now a function of just two things, E to the minus I two pi N alpha, which is just a complex number that you could compute, and this new function, S of alpha and N. But what is this function? Well, let's do an example. Again, say N equals 11. Then S of alpha and 11 equals just a sum of four exponentials, each governed by its own prime number. You can think of each of these exponentials as a clock, each with its own prime number that determines how fast the clock spins. So 2 turns the slowest, 3 turns faster, 5 turns faster still, and so on. But remember, this is a sum. So we actually need to add up all the clocks tip to tail. Now watch what happens as we increase alpha. All the clocks wind around at their own rates. What we're interested in is not the behavior of any individual clock, but instead all of them together. Since we've chosen a pretty small value for N, nothing too exciting happens, but watch what happens if we pick a larger value for N, like 99. Now there are 25 prime numbers that are smaller than 99, and hence 25 clocks in our sum. Now as we increase alpha, all the clocks, again, wind around at their different rates. It almost looks like a dragon's tail. And for a while everything seems kind of chaotic, circling around the origin, but then, when alpha hits 1 over 6, the tail unwinds, and suddenly almost all the clocks point in a similar direction, and we get a large resultant value. If we increase alpha further, the clocks cancel out again until we hit the next magic point, 1 over 3. Here again, many clocks line up. And this curious pattern keeps repeating. For the majority of values of alpha, the clocks cancel each other out. But at a few special points, like a half, the tail unwinds, the clocks interfere constructively, and we get a large resultant value. - If the angle is, you know, 360 degrees divided by a whole number, you get some very particular behavior that's very predictable. Those are the angles at which this function, when you sum the primes, they actually go far from from 0. And what happens at a random angle, and you just start adding the primes up, it keeps changing which way it's pointing, and the thing just bounces around. - So why is this happening? Well, let's look at when alpha equals a half. Here what we're doing is multiplying each prime number in the exponent by a half. In other words, dividing each prime number by 2. So let's do this for each of the primes. In the first column, we'll write down how many times it can be divided by 2. And in the second column we'll write down the remainder. So 2 divided by 2 equals 1, leaving a remainder of 0. So we've just made one full rotation. 3 divided by two is 1, but that leaves a remainder of 1, so it makes one full rotation and then a half rotation. 5 divided by 2 is 2 with a remainder of 1. So it makes two full rotations and then a half rotation more. Now, we don't really care about the first column because it doesn't matter how many full rotations a clock makes, we only care about where the arrow ends up. And that's fully determined by the remainder. It's just the remainder times alpha. So from now on we'll just keep track of the remainders. And what we find is that all of the other remainders are equal to 1. So all clocks, except the first one, point the same way. This is because when we're dividing whole numbers by 2, there are only two possible remainders, 0 or 1. And since we're working with prime numbers, only 2 can have the remainder 0, because no other prime number is even, therefore, all other primes must share the remainder 1. (wind whooshing) Meaning all those clocks end up making another half rotation, so they all point left and constructively interfere. (wind whooshing) A similar thing happens when alpha equals a third. Now each prime is divided by 3. So the possible remainders are 0, 1, or 2. Again, 3 is the only clock that has remainder 0, so that points right. But all the other primes follow a special pattern, a pattern that makes the entire circle method possible. The remaining primes distribute themselves roughly equally between remainders 1 and 2, which means all the remaining clocks are rotated one third or two thirds of the way around the circle. Since these clocks are pointing to the left, again, we get constructive interference. And this pattern of constructive interference also occurs for other small rational fractions. But for non-rational numbers, you don't get these nicely restricted remainders. So the clocks are roughly distributed equally all over the circle, and you get destructive interference. (upbeat tense music playing) Hardy and Littlewood realized they could use this. Imagine taking this plot of the magnitude of the resultant arrow and wrapping it around a circle. What they found is that the majority of the contributions come from very small regions of the circle, what they called the major arcs. The rest of the circle only adds minor contributions. So they called these the minor arcs. This allowed them to split up their calculation into two parts. The major arc part gives you the main term for how many ways you can write a number N as the sum of three primes. And the minor arcs just gives you an error term. (upbeat classical music playing) They then showed that, if the generalized Riemann hypothesis is true, then the main term grows faster than the error term. So eventually, for some large enough number, call it K, this value will always be larger than 1, and the weak Goldbach conjecture holds. But there are two problems with this approach. The first is that they assumed that a generalization of the Riemann's hypothesis is true, which we don't know. And the second is that they didn't actually specify that number, K. I mean, how big of a number do you need to get to before you can guarantee that all numbers larger than that adhere to Goldbach conjecture? - Then we've got to wait until 1937 when Russian mathematician, Ivan Vinogradov, proves the same as Hardy and Littlewood. But he did it without the generalized Riemann hypothesis. So, you know, assumption free. - It's one thing to just assume the Riemann hypothesis, and say, ""Oh yeah, you can make some progress."" But Vinogradov's like, ""No guys, you don't need the Riemann hypothesis. You can really prove this stuff."" - But again, he gives some large enough number for which the weak Goldbach conjecture will hold without specifying that number. And so it's very unsatisfying. (bright classical music) Over the next 19 years, one of his students did get that satisfaction when he could specify that number. Do you want to have any guess as to what the number is? - 10 to the 50? 10 to the 80? 10 of the 3000? I don't know. I was guessing things that are far too low, probably. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's about 10 to the 6.8 million. - Wow, okay. - It's huge. But then you know, from here on, people start working on this method more, and they all use the same techniques. In 1989, the number was brought down to 10 to the 43,000. Next it dropped to 10 to the 7,194. And by 2002 it had dropped all the way down to 10 to the 1,346. Now that seems so much smaller than what we had before, but if you compare it to how many, you know, protons there are in the universe, which is 10 to the power 80, that's not something you can check by computer. It's absolutely, absolutely hopeless. Even if you turned the whole universe into a computer, you would still have no chance of solving this. So it really needed to get dragged down. - [Derek] This is roughly where the problem stood in 2005, when, Peruvian mathematician, Harald Helfgott became interested in it. (upbeat classical music playing) - He was reading papers about the weak Goldbach conjecture, and new techniques that were being developed. So these were the cutting edge techniques at the time. He was reading it and he thought. - I can do better. I'm having some ideas how to do better. And, you know, it took me a couple of weeks to get better estimates. Not still, you know, strong enough to revolutionize everything, but to make real progress. - So he gets to work and within a couple of weeks he's got better estimates than that in the paper. So now he's getting more confident, like, ""Okay, I got this."" - Of course, I was a bit naive. I underestimate some difficulties elsewhere. (upbeat bright string music) - To solve the problem, he realized he needed to do two things. One, get the computational number as high as possible, and two, get the constant down as much as he could, which is where the difficult math comes in. So, over the next eight years, he attacked the problem from both sides. Together with David Platt, he checked all numbers up to 8.8 times 10 to the 30 by computer. And by refining his math, he slowly brought down the constant number, K. (numbers ticking) By 2013, he gets the number all the way down to 10 to the 27, which is below the number that his computers had already checked. - So he solved it. He wrote up his results in a paper called ""The Ternary Goldbach Conjecture is True,"" which is quite the mike-drop title. So, nearly 300 years after Goldbach's original letter, Helfgott proved that every odd number greater than five can be written as the sum of three primes. And as a result, he also proved that every even number greater than 2, can be written as the sum of at most four primes. This is because you can always just add 3 to all the odd numbers to get all the even numbers. - So was it a big deal? Were people excited? (playful gentle music playing) - Yeah, it's a good question. I feel like it is mostly an obscure problem. I think the strong one, and this with both of these problems, like they don't have any direct application to the real world. (inquisitive music continuing) Because it's so simple, it has this massive wide appeal, and everyone will kind of know about it. It's also one of the oldest unsolved problems. What did you do when you proved it? - Well, I put it on the archive. Like any normal person. It was a big relief. - You know, given your success (playful piano music playing) with the weak form of the Goldbach conjecture, how do you feel about the strong form? - Oh, I think that's hopeless for the moment. (Casper laughing) And if it yields. If it were to yield during our lifetimes, I wouldn't bet on it, in fact, I would bet against it. - See, the reason the circle method works for the weak Goldbach conjecture is because this main term grows faster than this error term. But that's not the case for the strong Goldbach conjecture. - The major arcs are no longer major. The main contribution comes from the minor arc. So at least as much of the contribution comes from the minor arcs. - So, to solve t",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
e strong conjecture, we need some fundamentally new technique, or approach, but we haven't found it yet. (tense classical music playing) - The person who arguably got the closest was Chen Jingrun. (pen scratching) In 1956, Chen was recognized for his mathematical prowess, and, a year later, he became an assistant at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, where he spent the next 10 years working on problems in number theory, including Goldbach's conjecture. By 1966, he hit a major breakthrough. By using another approach, known as sieve methods, he proved that every sufficiently large even number is the sum of a prime and a number that's either a prime, or the product of exactly two primes, what we call a semi prime. - It's a very learned and brilliant proof. I think Andre Weil compared following his proof, is like climbing along the top of the Himalayas. (wind whooshing) You know, that you're way up high in (laughing) practically the stratosphere. It's such a sophisticated argument. - This was the closest anyone had gotten to solving the problem. (playful music continuing) Elated, Chen showed the proof to a colleague, who suggested he should announce the result, and then tidy it up before publishing. - But just as Chen announced his result, the country plunged into chaos. (dramatic music) (crowd shouting) - [Derek] In May,1966, chairman of the Communist Party, Mao Zedong, declared that bourgeois elements had infiltrated the government and society, and they must be purged. This marked the start of the Cultural Revolution, a radical campaign to defeat perceived enemies of the Party. With support from Mao, militant student revolutionaries, known as the Red Guard, (soldiers marching) stormed institutions. (soldiers marching) They burned books and turned on intellectuals. Teachers, scientists, and professors were subjected to brutal public spectacles, known as struggle sessions. They were beaten, humiliated, and forced to wear towering caps, and placards listing their supposed crimes, like capitalist sympathizer or enemy of the revolution. (emotional soft music) Across China, the pursuit of knowledge was replaced by fear and political conflict. By 1968, 131 of the 171 senior members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing faced persecution. And many others lost their lives. - Chen was one of the targets. (shove rattling) He was forced into manual labor, (fire crackling) and made to live in a converted boiler room with no electricity. (shove rattling) The Red Guard insulted him, spat on him, and beat him so badly that Chen often lost consciousness. - In one report, it was so bad that he may have tried to commit suicide. He jumped off of a third story building and, fortunately, didn't hit the ground. He landed on the second floor, and got injured, but didn't die. - [Derek] Despite all of this, (tense music playing) Chen kept secretly working on his math under the dim light of a kerosene lamp. Then on the 13th of September, (plane whirring) 1971, Mao's right-hand man died (camera clicking) in a mysterious plane crash. (camera clicking) After supposedly trying organize a coup. His death shattered the illusion of unity in the Party, (clicker clicking) and the cultural revolution began to lose steam. (clicker clicking) (bright dramatic music) - But Chen faced a dilemma. On the one hand, he wanted to publish his proof, but on the other he was terrified of being criticized, Unsure what to do, he turned to Luo Shengxiong, the head of the mathematical institute, who told him," """"The result is sound. You must publish."""" (dramatic music continuing) - [Derek] And so in April",1973, Chen published his theorem. Three years later, Mao Zedong died and the Cultural Revolution ended. Famous journalist, Xu Chi took note of Chen's story, and wrote an article about his achievements and hardship. (uplifting music) The article was reprinted in China's most popular newspaper, and read by millions. The State that, just 10 years earlier, silenced Chen now celebrated him as a national hero. His story was retold in schools, books, and films. He even got an asteroid named after him in 1996. - And imagine if he hadn't done it, you know, if he hadn't published it. Like all his work, his whole mission, his whole ideals, his whole vision, maybe no one would've known about it. It would've just been a little line somewhere, like," """"Oh", I've got this proof, but, yeah," I'm not gonna show it to you."""" You know? But so often we like shoot ourselves down", whereas really do your best and then put it out into the world, and then let the world, sort of, like evaluate it. And while Chen got incredibly close, he was never able to fulfill his ultimate dream, to solve the strong Goldbach conjecture. (dramatic music playing) Perhaps one reason why it's so hard to prove true is because maybe it's not. Maybe it's false. But if it is false, then there's a very easy way to show that, by finding a counter example. A single even number that can't be written as the sum of two primes. - If Goldbach is false, it would be very easy for you to convince me that Goldbach is false. - Just find a counter example. - That is the only way that you can convince me that Goldbach is false. If Goldbach is false, then it's false because there's a counter example. And if there's a counter example, then you can give me the counter example, and I can check for myself, then, yes, that's a counter example. - [Casper] In this pursuit, in 1938, a mathematician, named Nils Pipping, checked all numbers up to a hundred thousand, by hand, but he didn't find a single counterexample. Since then, modern computers have brought this number up to four quintillion, and the conjecture holds for every single one of them. - [Derek] In fact, we can also use computers to check in just how many ways a different number can be written as the sum of two primes, (bright music) which gives us this pattern. It looks like a curve with tails, it strongly resembles a comet, which is why this is known as Goldbach's comet. It shows that as the number gets larger, there are more and more ways to write every even number as the sum of two primes. And if we overlay our heuristic argument from before, we find that it matches up remarkably well. - The one way the conjecture could be false is if, for whatever reason, at some very large number, there's a conspiracy where this completely breaks down, and it suddenly drops below that line. Are there any examples where you suddenly have a big drop in the number of ways you can compose a number? - No, no, those asymptotics seem to hold very nicely. There are no big drops. - [Derek] So it seems like the conjecture should be true. - We've tested, by brute force, all the numbers up to four quintillion, and they all obey Goldbach's conjecture. So you might think that we should have found a counterexample by now, or, at least, a number that doesn't follow this general trend we've seen. But, on the scale of all numbers, four quintillion is nothing. So we'll have to come up with some smart approach, or fundamentally new way, of solving this problem. Now, as far as we know, solving Goldbach's conjecture doesn't really affect any other areas of math. And it also doesn't seem to have any direct applications to the real world. So you might think, why bother solving this problem? Why not work on some big problem that we know is important? But I think that misses the point. (gentle inquisitive music) - What if the Goldbach conjectures turns out it is opening up a whole new part of the multiverse of mathematical ideas. We don't really know 'cause we don't have the bird's eye view, or the God's eye view, of math. It's what it looks like to us right now on the web of math. So, I tend to dislike this picture of certain things are central (inquisitive music continuing) and other things are peripheral. People should do what fires them up. Because if you do that, you'll be passionate, you'll think about it all the time. You'll do it when you're in the shower. You'll think about it when you're driving. And you might do something remarkable because of that passion. And if you're just doing something 'cause you think it's important, I think you'll tend to be second rate, honestly. (laughing) I like the modest view that we don't know what's necessarily important, but we do know what we love. So work on that. (electronics whirring) (inquisitive music continuing) - Goldbach's conjecture frustrated mathematicians for centuries. And, for a long time, (wind whooshing) it seemed like an unsolvable problem. Many gave up, thinking it was just too big to tackle. But as we've seen, it only takes a few incredibly determined individuals who reject the status quo to keep pushing towards a solution. And it's not just big math problems. Life is full of inconveniences (bright happy music) that some of us just start to accept as unsolvable. For me, shaving was one of these things. The irritation, the razor burn, the cost of constantly replacing razors. It felt like something I just kinda had to put up with. But then I started using (choir vocalizing) the Henson Razor, and I can honestly say it was a game changer. (upbeat joyful music) I've been using it ever since we first started working together two years ago, and now I don't go anywhere without it. And it's not just me. (clicker clicking) Many of you have shared your experiences too. The experts from Henson come from the aerospace world and they applied the same obsessive focus to create a better shaving experience. Their razor is made using CNC machines, which are capable of achieving incredibly tight tolerances. The razor blades stick out just 0.03 millimeters. That means that the blade is perfectly supported, so it maintains its precise 30 degree cutting angle, and it reduces chaffer, the tiny up and down vibrations that can cause skin irritation. If you want a better shaving experience, engineered by experts," head over to hensonshaving.com/veritasium. Use my code """"veritasium"""" for a hundred free blades with the purchase of any razor.

dt_CG_xRnrY,Pompeii Changed How I Think About The Roman Empire - Smarter Every Day 310,,Educational,"This video is not for kids. We're going to talk about death. We're going to talk about difficult issues, exploitation of people by other people. We're going to talk about the reality of living in the Roman Empire in a way that I did not expect. But I think it's a really interesting video, and there's some really important lessons to be learned here and how people don't change. With that being said, I'm going to give you a moment to get all children out of the room unless you, as a parent or guardian, think it's appropriate for them, and you've reviewed this material. We're going to start now. When I was a kid in Sunday school class, Ms. Jamie Ray sometimes would tell me stories about a thing that happened in the Bible, which a lot of that happened in the Roman Empire. I used to imagine that when she brought the feltboard out, she'd put these kids on here, or she'd put these people on here. Everything just came alive to me. But I remember these being very vibrant and exciting stories, but everybody looked happy. If you zoom in here, these ladies, they have makeup on, and they look like me, which I don't think is what really... That wasn't really the way it was. It's interesting because when I think of Roman times or the Bible stories that happen in the Roman Empire, I often think about a scene like this. When I went to Pompeii, which was a city that was locked in time by the volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius, I was expecting to see the engineering marvels of the Roman Empire. I was expecting to see the streets, and we are going to see that, but I was expecting to walk away from that with a very different feeling than what I actually walked away with. Let's start with the simple facts of what happened in a city called Pompeii. I know the name Pompeii sounds like some Polynesian island, but it's actually located right on the Mediterranean Sea in Italy. It's located right here in between the modern cities of Sorrento and Naples, which at the time of the eruption were called Surrentum and Neapolis. Mount Vesuvius rises high above Pompeii, here in the Northwest. In 79 AD, Mount Vesuvius erupted, burying the cities of Pompeii, Oplantis, and Herculaneum in ash and pyroclastic flows. Most historians believe this occurred on August 24th of that year, but some think it may have been later in the year. It doesn't really matter. What we do know is that Herculaneum and Oplantis were hit immediately by pyroclastic flows, killing people almost instantly. But because of the direction that the wind was blowing that day, Pompeii was covered in ash first, and then it was later hit by subsequent pyroclastic flows. I really don't know what a pyroclastic flow is. When I think of a volcano erupting, I think of red, molten rock, lava, and magma flowing down a hill and covering things. But a pyroclastic flow, as I understand, is a little bit different. It's like rock and ash that's shooting down a hillside with hot gasses mixed in very, very quickly. And that creates this wave of all this what will become sediment flowing over the city. But there's this little layer, this boundary layer of hot gasses that these rocks and ash are floating on and just covering everything. It's a terrifying thing. There's a lot of interesting footage of pyroclastic flows online, but the only ones that I had the rights to were the US Geological surveys. Back when Mount St. Helen's erupted, there was a photographer that was in an aircraft with a 16 millimeter film camera. This is an eight millimeter film camera. We said this is a Bell and Howell film camera, but he was flying in the aircraft and he was shooting Mount St. Helen's from the air. You can see the pyroclastic flow running down the side of the mountain. It looks like dust running down really, really fast. That is extremely hot ash and rocks and all kinds of stuff like that. That is pyroclastic flow. There's a lot of modern footage, but I didn't have the rights to any of that. So this gives you an idea of what that cloud might have looked like as it was rushing towards Pompeiii. So these pyroclastic flows just instantly hit these cities and covered them and locked a Roman city in time. And I have thought about this my entire life. And my beautiful wife, Tara, planned a trip for us for our 20th anniversary, and we're going to get to see something that's been on my bucket list forever. So let's go get Smarter Every Day. My wife is excellent at planning and logistics, which is why I thought it was fascinating that she elected to hire a tour guide for Pompeiii. Why did you decide that a tour guide was the right decision? Just for that particular place. It was so big and there was so much to do that the only way to get in the door and to see the highlights was to have somebody do that for us. Tara likes to plan with Rick Steve's tour guides. If you know, you know. And on one of the forums about Pompe, she learned about pompetourguide.com, which we were very excited about because it says that Ciro is a fourth-generation tour guide. Hey, nice to How are you doing? Nice to meet you. Hey, Tara. Tara, nice to meet you. How are you? Ciro helped us get the correct tickets for the site, and then we followed him in to begin our tour. [C] So Pompeii was never destroyed by a river of lava, but was just buried and preserved under 25 feet. It means seven, eight meters of a Pommie Stone and ash. All what you have to imagine is a rain of a Pommie Stone and ash from the sky. That's the reason why all the roofs, all the upper part of the buildings collapsed. 30% of Pompeii, one quarter of it is still under the volcanic ash. 79 AD, the first eruption, 1748, the first excavation. It means for 18 centuries, all the other Roman cities and towns were all destroyed by the Barbarians, and all the other folks come after them, while Pompeiii was always so well preserved under a green hill, just like frozen in a time. That's the reason why nowadays it's so well preserved. Now we are in front of one of the main entrance the big arch over there is called the Porta Marina. Porta Marina, it means a sea gate. Why that? Down here there was the sea. Pompeii, it was a seaport town, commercial town, trading center. About 20,000 people used to live here at the time, and they used to sell really good quarts of olive oil, wine, clothes, wooden furniture. Every day, they used to come here, travel the sailors, merchants. That's a Vegas of 2000s ago. Imagine seven different gates like this one in front of us, all around two miles of city wall. And outside of the city wall, we have these buildings, where on the lower part, the public bath, the spa of the time. Right next to this ocean. The ocean would have been here. Yes. This one of the reasons why the Roman Empire it last so long, 12 centuries, from 700 years BC to 500 years AD. Until now, no other empire or democracy to last so long. Another reason why it lasts very long is because they did everything considering the needs of the common people. So aqueduct, sewage system, theater, spa, roads, all in a way to improve the daily lifestyle. So people felt to be loved by the Roman Empire, and they were always ready to fight against any others in a way to preserve the good lifestyle they got and supporting the Empire of Rome. [D] We headed into the street and it was surreal to be standing on stones that were built as a part of a road that belonged to the Roman Empire. [C] I would love to give you two important information before we go inside this complex of Spa. First important information, Pompeii, at the moment of the explosion, eruption of Vesuvius, it was a 700 years old town. Now, Pompeii was first to build 600 years BC, buried in 79 AD. So 700 years old town, which means twice older than modern states. To give you a better idea, very old. That's the reason why whenever we go around, all the buildings are all originals, but built using different stones and techniques. That's why in some parts we find the bricks, tuffa stones, marble, basalt. Second important information, you have to imagine all the walls inside and outside used to be covered by plaster and decorated by colors. So you have to imagine a very colorful building all around you. [D] Like painted? [C] Yeah, painted. You know why? It's a good combination of colors. It makes them feeling good. Once again, they are prepared psychologically. All the travels spend money in a happy way. Colors, wine, women, not just the walls of the wealthy houses like many people used to think, but the walls of the entire town, inside and outside, covered by plaster and decorated by colors. [D] That's awesome. [C] Amazing. The first part now of every complex of a spa. This opening in front of us, it was the gymnasium of the time where they did the rum or whistling a bit of sports before going in a spa. Please, let's go inside. Mind your step, watch your feet. I thought I knew what to expect when going into the spa. I thought it was be a hot water place, a cold water place, but I wasn't prepared for the brothel. First of all, the roof is not original. The roof has been redone by the archeologist with the same shape and the same stuff. So all the original roofs were done like this. What I mean with the wooden beams carved by terracotta tiles. Then you have to imagine the decoration all over 360 degrees. What I mean payments, walls, and also ceiling. The ceiling in some part is very well preserved, other part collapse at the time. But you have to imagine decoration and colors everywhere. We have original mosaic floor in all of the complexes of a spa. Why that? Beautiful decoration, not slippery with a wet feet. Beautiful and functional. For the Romans, everything is to be beautiful and functional, not just beautiful, just function, but both. We are talking about original colors, frescoes on walls of 2000s ago, and on your right, the reception of the time where they did a welcome to the complex of a spa. [D] So this is where you check in? [C] Yes. Welcome. And then the colors after 2000 years look so new, so vivid for a special technique they use at the time. They prepare every walls with the three layers of a plaster, very thick layer of plaster. On the last layer of plaster, still fresh, they paint it. That's why fresco's painted on the fresh plaster. It absorbs all the colors and stays forever. I always do the example of a tattoo. When we do a tattoo, the colors goes through the seven layers of skin and stays forever. The same technique they use at the time. That's why you find all the walls carved with this very thick layer of plaster all over, just on the last layer of the colors. And the colors from all what they can find in the nature, the pigments of a flower, of a plant. [D] That looks like an angel. [C] A CUPID, yeah. [D] Oh, it's CUPID. [C] What is important to see over here in this first room? To the right, we have a door. Of course, it's not the original door of the time. Behind the door, we have the stairs leading up to the second stories. And we have many erratic paintings on the walls showing different positions of sex. Now, nothing to do with the modern pornography, but always don't avoid any misunderstanding between the travelers and the girls, speaking different languages. It was like a menu. Look at the numbers. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The numbers indicate the lockers where they put clothes, but also the position of a sex. Unfortunately, we miss the other speciality of the house. Number 13, 14, 15. Just your imagination. [D] Seeing this was pretty heartbreaking. There's the exploitation of people, many of them slaves by other people for sexual pleasure, financial gain. There's just a lot wrong here. And I think I would be naive if I just pretended like, Oh, the ancient world was the only place where this thing exists. There are probably more slaves on Earth today than in the ancient Roman Empire. That's just like raw numbers. That's just the way it is. And there are financial incentives today for people to be sexually exploited and trafficked. So I just thought about the total depravity of human nature and how it was just a very sad thing to see it all here. But there's something about seeing people being able to be ordered on a menu that really bothered me. As a Christian, in thinking about the context of Jesus entering into this society where the normalization of sexual exploitation was everywhere. It's very interesting, and it helps me understand how radical and dangerous the teachings of the young Christian church would have been in a location like this. Fascinating. A There's a lot of stuff to think about here. We looked around the rest of the spa, and I saw all kinds of interesting engineering things that went into how they made the floors warm and things like that. But as we exited the spa, I asked Ciro an interesting question, and he gave me a fascinating answer. When it was uncovered, initially, was it colorful? [C] Yes, it was more beautiful than now. Pompeii, first time, excaved it, there was something left intact. Colors everywhere, original mosaic flow, original statues all around. Then after the first excavation, during the years, the colors disappearing under the pollution, rain, sun. Then the Second World War. During the Second World War, more or less 160 bombs exploded in this archeological area, destroying much others. And then the pollution, and then we don't have a good technical preservation. That's why I'm totally agree with the archeologist to go very slow with the excavation. To preserve for the next generations. Otherwise, in a bit of time, we lose everything because the things today are better preserved underneath than outside. Pompeii today is still very unique in all over the world, but first time, excaved it may be more beautiful than now. At this point, we walked up towards the center of the city on the hill where Pompeii was built, and we got our bearings. Up here, you can see that Pompeii was built in an amazing location. We are on top of a hill in the middle of everything. We have all the Sorrento Peninsula on your left, the islands of Ischian cover in this direction behind by the wall, the Mediterranean Sea down there, which was once much closer. Nice breeze from the sea. Can you feel it? Yes. That's why locations, locations, locations. But the Romans were the first to pave the roads all around. They did the 75,000 miles of highways all around. That's why the expression, All the roads lead to Rome. But they realized, very soon that on the same road is to go the animals and the people. So now there was a problem because the animals left excrements on the floor and people used to walk on it. This was not really good. What the Romans invent for the people for the very first time are the sidewalks, left and right, everywhere. All along the sidewalk is the people, just the animals. The sidewalks. All right, Destin, but the problem is still on the floor. Pee-pee, poopoo, how to wash the roads. In all of the city, they got many water fountains always left open, cleaning and washing the roads every time. Fantastico, clever. Yeah. How to cross road avoiding wet feet? Look down there. The central stepping stones to cross the road, avoiding wet feet. That's amazing. Clever. Yes. But during the night, no illumination, no electricity. How to recognize the roads by the sidewalk? The small and white marble chips, the reflectors, the cat's eyes, to reflect either the moonlight or the torches light people normally got during the evenings. So smart. [D] So the white rock in the road. [C] We have the central stepping stones to cross road, avoiding wet feet. So you can avoid the poop. But the wagon wheels, is this the same gage as the the wagon wheel? Yes. But the wagons, the chariots, how they were able to pass through. Now, first of all, they all got the same gage, so standard. Always pulled by two animals, usually two donkeys in a line with the two wheels. Imagine, one one can wheel to the right, one can wheel to the left, one wagon in this direction, another one to the other side. So two-way road. Whenever you find the three or four central stepping stones, it means two-way. But if you find one or two, it's one-way only. But once again, one-way, two-way, sidewalks, crosswalks. [D] One thing I find interesting about crosswalks in modern society is these white squares are like the raised stones in Pompeiii at pedestrian crossings, which I think is really cool. It makes me think about not stepping here from now on, but I think that's neat. Isn't that cool? Okay. Yeah. [C] The most funny picture to the in Pompeiii is crossing the roads like the Beatles. Every road. Then we have a Mt. Vesuvius in front of us. The volcano, before the eruption, was much higher and big than now. Can you see the right peak and the left one? Yes. With your imagination, put together high in the sky, it was one big cone. After the eruption 79, one part blew up. [D] Do we have any idea how tall it was? [C] More or less 2,000 meters high. Today is 1,281 meters high. [D] Wow. [C] It's still active. [D] It's ominous, isn't it? It feels like it's overbearing. [C] It looks very close from here. And still active, one of the most dangerous volcano in the world. That's why in a bit of time, when you go back home, in a bit of time staying home, you hear about another eruption Vesuvius. Please, thinking about me, you pray for me. You pray for me. [D] Absolutely. [C] Your guide for Cira. Now, we say 79 AD, the eruption Vesuvius. Pompeiii was destroyed by Pommie Stones and ash. Above the ash grew the vegetation. Everybody forgot about Pompeiii for 18 centuries because Pompeiii became a green hill. Now, who and how Pompeiii was founded? Now, Pompeiii was founded by the Spanish with an accident because during the 1748, during the first excavation, we were under the Spanish domination, and the Spanish were building in this area an aqueduct. Just in cutting the hill of Pompeiii, they found the remains of an ancient Roman town. So Pompeiii was founded by the Spanish with an accident after 18th century that it was frozen in a time. [D] So this is a mixture of terracotta brick and volcanic stone. [C] Yeah. Now, I tell you more about bricks. Obviously, you're very interesting. Now, the bricks are originals, but the bricks got a cost because they need to produce. In a way to save money during the constructions, they use bricks only in the corners. Look, all the corners made by bricks, the rest of the wall with the pua stones, local stones, having no cost, but then always carved by plaster, decorated by colors. It was once never possible to see how the buildings were made out of. Everything was under, covered by plaster, and they created- [T] To make it very straight and just the- [C] Yes. [D] And then they just had volumetric fill in the middle, right? [C] All the corners made by bricks. Inside the wall, the rest of the wall, Puwa Stones, local stones, having no cost. East-west was the longest side of Pompeiii because having no electricity, the sunlight was important. Here, from the sunrise till to the sunset, they always got sunlight all along this side, east, west. Everything, once again, was like in a modern town. Look, sidewalks left and right, crosswalk in the middle, house and shops left and right, second store with balcony, terrace, colors everywhere, a large number of wagons. Look how deep are the tracks left by the wheels of the wagons. The wheels of the wagons were made by wooden all around an iron circle, no shock absorbers, very noisy, produce the tracks, the groups on a floor. Originals. [D] Wow. [C] They were very systematic people. Look, shop, house, shop, shop, house, shop. The building is over. It's a block. Then start another block, shop, house, shop. Very systematic people. Okay, you're smart. Anydesk is free. That's the sponsor for this video. And so my first question is, if something's free, does that mean I'm the product? And the answer is not in this case, because AnyDesk knows they're so good at what they do that if you use it, you're going to love it and you're going to want to get a business account and use it at your employer, and your employer will then pay money to use AnyDesk, which means you get to use it for free, which is a big deal. I'm going to show you how I use AnyDesk to do remote control of my computer from a different location. That's what AnyDesk does, and let me show you how I do it. I am on the homestretch of writing an academic paper, which I've learned a lot about myself and that I'm not great at academic writing. But let me show you something I've used AnyDesk to do. So all of these represent different simulations that I've done as a part of something called smooth particle hydrodynamics. And this, for example, this one thing right here, this took, I'd say, two days to do. I had to set up the simulation, run the simulation, and I was running it all on my computer, and I didn't want to be chained to the computer while it was running. So what I can do is I can use any desk on my phone, and I can log in, and I can just see what is happening on the simulation on my phone, just like that. And that's how I did it. Here is a video of me on a train in England for an upcoming video that we're working on. And I just logged into my computer that was in Alabama. And I was like, Man, this is crazy. I'm on a train in England, but I'm logged into the computer in Alabama. Nuts. But another thing you can use it for is to move files around. They've got a built-in FTP system, so you can move files from one system to the other. It's all integrated, and it works seamlessly. Anydesk is awesome. You can try it. It's free. Anydesk.com/smarter. If you want to check it out, I think you will really enjoy it. Literally free. You get to use it. The business model here is they're like, well, if people want to use this for their job, the idea is you're going to use it, you're going to like it, and you're going to take it to your business and get an account there. Anydesk. Com/smarter. Big thanks to Anydesk, specifically Matt, for hooking me up with sponsorships here on Smarter Every Day. Let me do really cool stuff, giving me some of my life back, enabled me to go out and about while still getting the stuff done that I want to do. Yeah, that's it. [C] Now, over here, I'm able to show you one example of a water fountain. Now, the water fountains were made by four blocks of lava, like this one, one, two, three, and four, or four blocks of white marble like the next I'll show you later. Anyway, the four blocks used to be tied together by iron, solded in stones by lead. When the fountain was full-So this is lead? Yes. And this is iron? Yes. Was the iron poured in position or laid in? No, it was the iron, and then they put the lead to fix. I see. When the fountain was full, also animals were able to drink a clean water from the pool, like horses, cows, donkeys. But through the central opening that every fountains got, the water flowed out, slant the road, cleaning and washing the roads every time. [D] So it flow out right here? [C] Yes. [D] Does this represent this is for your animals? [C] Yeah, this one is a face of a bull. Now, because after the time, the roads got no name. Only the most important road, like in Rome, the Appia Way, by the roads in the middle of the province, the town, they got no name. That's why every water fountain got a different decoration. Here, for example, we had a fountain with a face of a bull, and probably you were able to find the fountain with a face of a horse, of a and so on, just to recognize into the city. When they got some problem with the water, they start to close the water first in a spa, then in the houses at the end of the water fountains, where the fountains always left open. Then we have back to the road, like you can see over here, three or four central stepping stones to wait towards the main road. If you see on your left... [D] Which left? Sorry. [C] Over there. One or two is It's one way. [D] Yeah. [C] But unfortunately, we don't know which way. I don't know. [D] One way, straight. [C] But we have to go up there, please. [D] If I've learned anything about Italian roads, it's like you just make your own rules. [C] On the way up to this house, I'm able to show you original lead water pipes. They got lead water pipes everywhere under Side roads, sorry, under the sidewalks, under the roads, not visible. But the lead is poisoning. Yes, it is. But the water flow always along the pipes, leaves a layer of calcium all around, now protected the rest of the water. Let's say that they got drinkable water in all of the city. But in any case, we are talking about 2000s ago, at the time they used to die very young, 40, 45 years. And this is one of the reasons. The lead water pipes. Lead was poisoning. But the most impressive thing to me, in Italy, we never had lead. Romans went to conquer UK just for lead. [D] Really? Wow. [C] What I would love to understand, we are visiting the final result of all the knowledge that the Romans went to conquer all the other lands. Otherwise, it looks like the Italians were genial, the other folks were stupid. No. That's why I did the comparison with the Americans and the States of nowadays. Today in US, Italians, Jewish, Spanish, Japanese, Chinese, working side by side and improving everything for the state. And here we are, 2000s ago, exactly the same. [D] See, what is this? Is this iron? What is this ring? [C] This one is iron, this one is lead, and this one is the calcium of water. Over there, I'm able to show you how two pipes used to be joined together. [D] Oh, gosh, I'm so excited. Excited. So excited. We still do the same after 2000 years. [D] They would wrap the lead around it? What happened? I don't understand. [C] Yeah. So how two pipes used to be joined together, sold it with lead. The Latin word for lead is plumbum, which is where we get plumbing, which is awesome. So I could make an entire video about the lead pipes used in ancient Rome because I've always been fascinated by it. In fact, I went to Bath, England, to the Roman Baths there. If you ever get a chance to do that, it's fascinating. They have a fantastic display there that explains how they make lead pipes. You can see they've got a big inget or a pig of lead here, like Ciro was saying. There's a lot more lead in the UK than there is down in Italy. And this display here teaches you how the pipes are made. They wrap it around a piece of wood, they crease it on one side, and they use some clay to stop up one side, and then they pour multon lead to seal that seam, which is fascinating. I could make an entire video about how the lead pipes work in ancient Rome, but let's just get back to Pompeii. That's beyond the scope of this video. solder it, yeah. [C] Iron. This one is the calciumal wood. [D] It looks like they held the It looks like they held the pipe down. [C] Yeah, because the lead water pipes were always still. One with the T-connection is to bring water directly to the shops and the houses, and the other lead water pipe bring the water directly from one to the next water tanks, wasting no pressure. The lead water pipes were always still. [D] You know there's been a ton of scientific papers written on this. [C] Look, Destin, so we have other lead water pipes. Oh, yeah. But they go everywhere. The only thing that we can see today, only in a few parts of the city, not everywhere. [D] So would this have been... So this is the side of the road here. Would there have wood here? Or this is just dirt? [C] No, just a sidewalk, terracotta. I mean, maybe later I show you. But they go like sidewalks. [D] It's amazing. [C] You can see also here. Look. [D] Oh, wow. The lead water pipes. The junctions. [C] It's closed here. [D] Yeah, so nobody can damage it. [C] Yeah. Other. You know what? [D] It's a really big pipe junction. [C] Yeah. They go up. You know why? [D] Why? Because-they go over the road. [C] Oh, no. On top of this pillar, this one, it was a pillar. On top of this pillar, they got an additional water tanks. [D] Wow. [C] Yes. [D] So local storage. [C] Because the water... I'll now explain you about the water system. The water was a spring water coming from the mountain, Avellino, Mount Serino, 40 miles far from here. They did an aqueduct made by arches, a bit slant, to let the water running from on top of the mountain till it reach the highest part of Pompeiii over there, where they built a huge water tank. You see the building full of bricks? It's the main huge water tank. The water for gravity, all along the lead water pipes used to flow in all of the shops and the houses. But there was a problem because the water lost the pressure. No pumps at the time, no engine. How to give water till to last shop, the last house in the city? They invented What we used to say the system of communicated the vases. They did the pillars all over the city like this one, on top of which an additional water tanks, which was smaller than the main one, but at the same height. And the lead water pipes were always still, like I told you before. So one with the thick connection used to bring water in all of the houses and the shops. The second lead water pipe used to bring water directly from one to the next water tanks, wasting no pressure. Try to do this experiment at home. If you go home, you put glasses of the same size. If you connect them, put water in the first glass, the water automatically goes in all of the others. That's what they invented 2000s ago without pumps, without engine. Impressive. And I'm able to show you so you can touch actually the original calcium of water on the pillar. This one is the original calcium of water of 2000s ago. [D] That's the Yeah. [C] Original calcium of water of 2000 years ago. [D] It's amazing. It's incredible. You like chemistry? Taking a picture? [C] Look, this is all the calcium. You see, these are all the pipes. [D] Yes. [C] Go to the next water tank. That's why you see the lead water pipes up. [D] Yeah, it's amazing. We're about to enter a famous house in Pompeiii known as the vetti house. It's the house of two brothers. They seem to be rich. Ciro is trying to explain to me what I'm going to see when I walk in the house, and I'm just not picking up what he's putting down. So he just comes out and says it, and I think you'll get an idea for what these people are like as soon as we walk in the door. At the very main entrance of the vetti house, V-E-T-T-I. It was the house of two Roman brothers. They were two very rich way merchants. I show this house, and all the houses are the same, what I mean the same layout, the sides and the decoration used to change between one house and the others. Now, at the very main entrance of this house, we have a God, the Priapus. Many times we found God, the Priapus in Pompeji. [D] Priapus? [C] Yes. [D] What is that word? [C] Priapo. And I show you. [D] Okay. [C] God, the Priapus, always showing his big penis, his big phallic symbol. [D] Oh, I see. [C] No, many, many times we found a phallic symbol. So many, many times, sorry, we found God, the the priapus in Pompeiii, here is a very well preserved. Why got the priapus many times? Because the phallic symbol, it got different meanings, but one of the most important meaning, it was good luck, abundance, prosperity. Now, the owners of this house, they want to show the others that they were rich. So at the very main entrance, we have god the priapus with his big Feli symbol. He's, Okay, you are rich but not elegant at the very main entrance of the house. Please. [D] I see. So was he a Roman God? [C] Yes, it was the Roman God. There was the phallic symbol, symbol of abundance, prosperity, good luck, fertility. Now, the owners of this house were just rich but not elegant. They were new, were rich, a show off, new money. Now, they want to show the others that they were rich. Imagine that at the very main entrance of the house, we have found the two Bronze Money chest, two Bronze Money box, one to the left, one to the right. Literally to show their money. Yeah. What? We have found the two name on it, Aulus Vettius Restitutus, Aulus Vettius Conviva, the name of the two Roman brothers. That's why Vetti house. Please, I'll show you. Let's go this way. The house of Vetti takes his name from the owners. Aulus Vettius Conviva, Aulus Vettius Restitutus. The two Roman brothers. [D] Brothers own the house together. [C] Yes. Two original Bronze Money chest. Bronze Money box. [D] They just had treasure chest just sitting out so everybody can see it. [C] In a way to show the house, the very main entrance of the house. [D] People don't change, do they? [C",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 No, no, no, no. Nothing changed. With the Romans, we are at the very beginning of our modern days. Nothing changed. Ciro showed us more of the Vedi house. We We had a dining room and what's called the triclinium, where there would be three couches where people could lay down. We also saw the kitchen, and the bathroom seemed to be co-located. Ciro showed us the original water pipe that brought water into the kitchen. Then, of course, there was this. We have another room for sex with one, two, three frescoes on a wall showing this from position of sex. The one to the left, the one to the right, very well preserved. I suggest to have a picture First of all because this house reopened after 20 years, only a few months ago, but also because you can see the details. You can see how the bed were made at the time, the women already got their bra. [D] Is it possible that it was just the bedroom? [C] I think this one not. This one was a room for sex because I told you before, so they used to point in. I want this, I want this, I want this. Like a manual. [T] So it had holes for a second story in that. A little second story. [C] Probably where you used to stay other prostitutes or other slaves. Well, probably this The owners of this house were two very rich wine merchants, but they also owned prostitutes. Over there is to work slave prostitutes. Now, slave prostitutes used to work together with other girls in a small rooms, stone They got the pimp. They were interested to work hard in a good way because probably, tips by tips made by the Travis, they were able to buy the freedom. They're going to do the same job on their own. That is the difference. [D] I don't like the guys that own this house. [C] Come along. Now, this room, it was a bedroom. Here you have to imagine a bed. What is important to see, to understand is that 2000 years ago, they already knew the perspective and the optical illusion of depth, something which is a very modern fashion. The French people call it the Trompe l’oeil, the trick of the eyes. Giotto, Michelangelo, Donatello. They need to re-scarbed. It's something the Romans already knew at the time. But at the time, Pompeo was still carved, was still buried. In this room, not second stories, but they want to give you the illusion of the second stories. How? They There is this big cram molding running all around, sharing the lower part to the upper part. On the upper part, the prospective. So it looks like that we can walk on top of the stairs or we can enter in a wall. Oh, Yeah, you can see the perspective of the stairs really good, right? Yes, very good. There's this big crown molding running all around, sharing the lower part to the upper part. On the upper part, the prospective. It looks like that we can walk on top of the stairs or we can enter in a wall. [D] Oh, yeah. You can see the perspective of the stairs really good, right? [C] Yes, very good. There is this big crown molding running all around, sharing the lower part to the upper part. Now, with the perspective, the rooms, the houses looks bigger than normal. [D] Oh, yeah. Look at this. We have those stairs going in from the right, and we have these going in from the left. [C] Now, the first part of every house or home is the eight room. We are in the eight room. The eight room, they got the bedrooms and cabinets to the right and to the left. They got the opening in the middle of the roof for the skylight. Since it used to rain through the opening, the square pull on the floor, collect the raining water through the hole, the raining water flow down to the road, cleaning and washing the roads every time. It's exactly the same for the slaves, just smaller. Here we have a beautiful picture that you can have for yourself. So this a CUPID on a cancer. When you go home, you can print, you can put on your house. It's one of the best, maybe the best souvenir that you can have from Pompeiii, from this house too. And I show you also a picture to send to your friends. This one is for yourself. This one is a picture to send to your friends. They will love it. Oh, goodness. [D] What did you think about the statue of Priapas? [T] I don't remember it. [D] It was the big wiener guy. [T] I obviously didn't think much of it. I don't remember it. [D] That's funny. [C] Here we have Urania. Urania was the goddess of the universe showing the world. This one is the second time that we can see the world. So 2000s ago, they knew that the world was a globe. Now is the time to show you a bakery. [D] Okay. [C] Not a simple one. What I mean the best preserved in all of the city. We have founded the 37 bakeries all around. Yeah, please. [T] I wonder how many brothels. [D] Who knows? [C] We are in what I consider the best preserved. Look at the mills. The mills were made by two lava stones. We have a conical block of lava, this one fixed on the floor, on top of which a bical block of lava. They put the grain from the top and they got a wooden pole in one hole, another one to the other side, and the upper stone used to be turned around by slaves or animals, usually donkeys. From And on the bottom came the flour. All around, a wooden collect where the flour was collected. All along this side, you have to imagine a table with the four or five slaves used to work and produce loaves of bread. And then, hard to believe, the oven, which is just the same we still use today in a typical Italian pizzeria. Nothing has really changed. The same arch, the same quality of bricks, the small wooden storage, and the dome inside. [D] The dome inside? [C] Yeah. My dear, if after 2000 years, not 200, not 200, but 2000, we did not invent it anything better than this, is because the taste of the food cooked in an oven like this always got a special taste, a smoked taste. We invented other kinds of ovens, like the electric one. But the same pizza, cooked in an oven like this is the original pizza. Cooked in electric ovens is no more a pizza. We call the focaccia, not pizza anymore. But joking apart, in this oven, they found the three pieces of bread inside, so black carbon inside. It means at the moment of the eruption, they were working over here. When suddenly the eruption was there, they ran away, they left the job undone. But we understand that the eruption was during the day and not during the night because they were working. [D] Wow. I've never seen a mill like this. Yeah. This iron. [C] Yeah, they're Italian. [D] It's got the lead on there like the others. [C] Yeah, look at that. In here, there's also a picture of the mill. That's good. The wooden poles. [D] I have never seen. Is it a concrete mill? [C] Pardon? [D] Is it made of concrete or lava stone? [C] Lava stone. Concrete block of lava. They got lava stone from a previous eruption. [D] Yeah, it's amazing. I have never seen a mill design, like a double cone mill. We've seen the rolling stone mill, right? We've seen the mill stone that's a horizontal disk, but a double cone. I wonder if that's more efficient. [T] Well, it would have to because it's funneling down, only a small amount can enter at the same time instead of a large amount. Then it would spread it bottom to be able to drive it. Does that make sense? [D] It does. [C] All right. Now, with yours, would What do you think is this room? [D] Is this what I think it is? [T] I would have thought bathroom. [D] Well, I think I've read about this. Is this a fast-food joint? [C] Yes. This is the best example of what I call the wine bar and fast-food. Yeah? Wine bar and fast food because in these terracotta jars closing in a wall was possible to keep either cool wine or warm food. They used to work like the thermos of today, inside which if you put something cold, stays cold, something warm, stays warm. I call wine bar and fast food, but the Latin word is a thermapoleum, a thermos, because it has to work like the thermos of today. Imagine one side, a buffet, vegetable soup, fish, meat, chicken, wherever. They got the leads on top made by wooden, one side of buffet to the other side of wine bar. That's because I told you this terracotta jar was possible to keep either cool wine or warm food. [D] Something about seeing seeing how normal people probably ate lunch on the streets of the Roman Empire was fascinating to me, and it made me want to connect more with the everyday things that they did. Now, a lot of the artifacts they found at Pompeiii were not locally on site. Somewhere, I'll show you later, but many of the artifacts found in Pompeiii and Hercuelenium were taken to the National Archeological Museum in Naples. Tara and I had a few minutes to speedrun that museum, and we saw all kinds of fascinating things. We saw ancient Roman glass. We saw lamps that they would use to light their houses. We saw art, paintings that looked like menus. We saw mosaics. One thing I thought was really interesting are these little idles, these little statues, some of which were terracotta, some were bronze. I find these statues to be fascinating because I've read about them. In Acts 19, it's talking about the disturbance that's come up into the Roman Empire because this new thing called Christianity, or it's referred to here as the Way, it's disturbing the sexual ethics and the market forces of the day. Here you can see, Acts 19: 23, About that time, there rose no little disturbance concerning the Way. For a man named Demetrius, a silversmith who made silver shrines of Artem, brought no little business to the craftsmen. So Demetrius made stuff like this: Spoons, saucers, plates, silver, right? But Demetrius also made things like this: little bitty idles to certain gods, but he made them out of silver. And it's fascinating because Demetrius recognized if these gods are no longer assigned the deity that the culture assigned them, then their value goes to zero, except for the weight of the silver, right? So he riled people up and got them really angry at these new group of people, these Christians or the way. And I just think it's fascinating. We're reading context about people that made things like this, like this Silver Paper Shaker. This person cared about the affairs of the finances of the Roman Empire. Christianity was subversive and dangerous to the political and financial forces of the day. It just made things really real to me in a way that I hadn't thought about before. Also, I thought their keys were really cool. It's just really cool to look at the keys. I don't know why. Oh, my goodness. Look at these keys, Tara. That is amazing. So let's go back to the streets of Pompeiii. And fair warning, the next thing we're about to see is pretty somber. We're not going to see the actual bodies of the people that were buried in ash. We're going to see plaster cast of the voids where the bodies were. So this is pretty heavy stuff. [C] Hello, my dears. Now, how they did the plaster cast? Imagine, during the excavations, the archeologist felt under the volcanic ash empty spaces left by the decompositions of the bodies. What to do? They simply did injections of the liquid plaster in these empty spaces. Liquid plaster took the shape of the previous bodies. When it dried up, the archeologist cleaned all the ash away and appeared the bodies in same positions the people were when they died. It means the original bonds, scelodons, is still in there. The plaster cast are so important for three reason. We can You see the original shape of the bodies, the original bones, skeleton, is still in there, and last moment of life, people died in these positions, like you can see. The first reason people died was a Asphyxiation, suffocated by gas. They were not able to breathe, and then buried. This guy in the middle is not praying, but he's got part of his clothes near the mouth and the nose. So first that is specific and then buried. Looking at the cars, they were not very tall. They were short, tiny people. All right? Take your time for pictures. [D] That's pretty solemn, isn't it? [T] How many people died? Do they know? [C] No, it's difficult to say how many people died, how many people escape. At the same time, it's made difficult to see how many people used to live in a house, how many slaves they got. But I would love to show you also other bodies. Maybe more beautiful than this because other bodies are without a glass on it. [T] Okay. [C] Yes. You can see very close. Of course, we are not able to touch. [D] There's also a museum on site, and we went in and saw what was possibly a family of four discovered together. [C] Look, Destin. Here, we are able to see the original skull of the baby. [D] Oh, that's awful. It's very interesting, though. [C] The original skull. Also some clothes. [D] It's a violent moment. What did you think about seeing the bodies of the people, the plaster cast the bodies. [T] I mean it made it real, right? It made it very real to see. [D] Families. [T] Families. [D] Yeah, it was heavy. [T] And the protection, the way that they... The the way that they lived out the very end, right? [D] Yeah. It's bizarre to think that those plaster cast were actual people. And there's something very odd about being right next to a person's final moments. It doesn't feel sacrilegious, or I don't... What's the word? It's heavy. It's just a very... It's a very heavy thing. It made the Roman Empire come alive to me in a way that nothing else ever has. I had this image in my head of what Rome was, and I walked away from Pompeii thinking something very, very different about Rome. I thought slavery was a really big part of this. They were out in the open with a lot of the sexual stuff. It was just a vile time. [T] That's so funny because I didn't walk away feel... That's not how I left it. I left it seeing how storefronts were set up and the logistics of running a house worked and how things were built in a way for function without what we have today. So I think I took a little bit different. [D] I guess being in the physical space, you felt like you were on the streets and you got to experience it in a different way. Tara and I really enjoyed our time with Ciro. He was super professional, very patient with us, taught us so much through stories. And when we saw this model at the National Museum in Naples, it made us realize that we had only scratched the surface because the site is huge. There's an amphitheater, another brothel, the Temple of Issus. There was so much more that Ciro wanted to show us, but because we had to catch a train, we had to cut it short. Ciro, thank you. So let's just Let's just end it here. If people want to get a private tour with you, you have other things you didn't show us, of course. [C] Yeah, definitely. The area is very big. How do they get in touch with you? You can go on website and contact Pompeiiitourguide.com this is our website, me and my dad. [D] Sounds great. You're fourth generation, right? [C] Yes. [D] Thank you so much. [C] Thank you so much to you. It was a pleasure to meet you. [D] Okay, I hope you enjoyed this episode of Smarter Every Day. And I hope that when you think of the ancient Roman Empire, this video has made you look at it a little bit differently. It certainly did me. And I'm grateful that I was able to do this with my wife. It was a fascinating experience. I think we grew as a couple and as people experiencing this together. And so I'm grateful that you let me do this. So big thanks to everybody that supports Smarter Every Day at Patreon.com/smartereveryday. I'm grateful for your support. It's changed my life," and I hope that I continue to earn your support by doing this stuff. So that's it. I'm Destin. You're getting Smarter Every Day. Have a good one. Bye."""
cRaKMTK7ea0,I Went Into a Nuclear Plant and It Changed How I Think About Radiation - Smarter Every Day 309,,Educational,"I'm about to show you a video of the moment when two nuclear plant workers tell me how they really feel about the safety of their job. I wish the whole public knew how safe what we really did was, considering how dangerous what we're dealing with is. You agree with that? Yeah, absolutely. I think nuclear power would be tenfold what it is today if we had done a much better job of educating the public. A lot of people come to me and ask me, what, is nuclear dangerous? I'm like, the people that I know, they retire out, they die of other natural causes, not related. It's not cancer. We don't have all these issues. You'll hear a lot of propaganda sometimes outside of nuclear, but it's just one of the... Man, it's one of the safest claims that we ever did. Because for the most part, it's a very low amount of dose. Occupational dose is exceptionally low, right? Yeah. I mean, for example, we're talking right in the middle of the rem over here, like a chest X-ray is 10 millirem, maybe. [Destin] A single X-ray. Single chest X-ray is like 10 millirem. [D] Got it. And I won't see that in a year, maybe. It depends on what you do. Some people will see more than that, but Definitely not within one trip in McClane. Right. This is the second video in the Smatter Every Day Deep Dive series, In the Nuclear Power. I've always instinctively thought nuclear power was a good idea, but now I'm trying to understand it at its core, pun intended. And to do that, we're traveling all over the country and meeting the people that know this stuff, and I'm asking them the hard questions. I'm so excited about this whole series, and today's video is about radiation and how nuclear workers stay safe. Nuclear is a loaded word. It has an association with nuclear weapons, which is understandably scary. There's other words like contamination and radiation. If you don't understand what's going on around the physics involved in these words, it can be quite frightening. Those two men that I just showed you in the video, they work around nuclear reactions every day, and they've done it for decades, and they're not afraid. It's clear to me that they have some understanding I don't have, and I'm guessing you might not have that understanding either. We are about to receive training to enter an active nuclear power plant. At the end of this video, you and I are going to enter this nuclear power plant into a special area of the plant that has both contamination and radiation. The hope is that when we're armed with this new understanding, we're going to be just as confident as these gentlemen are. Let's go get Smarter Every Day and learn more about nuclear power. In the first video, we went out to Idaho National Lab, where we saw EBR-1, the World's first nuclear power plant. That particular plant was a fast reactor plant that also bred new fuel. That video laid the foundation for our understanding on how neutrons drive nuclear reactions. This is the second video in this series, and today we're going to do something really cool. We're going to go to Browns Ferry Nuclear Power Plant here in North Alabama. This plant is a really big deal for my local area. It's operated by TVA, the Tennessee Valley Authority, and it contributes power to the grid for houses all over North Alabama and the surrounding area. So after a long process to get permission to enter the plant, I got a phone call that said, Hey, you need to come out and do some training first. I usually shoot smarter everyday videos alone, just me and a camera. But every once in a while, when something's very challenging, I ask my buddy George, who helps me make these videos, to tag along with me, and that's what we did today. We went out to Browns Ferry for the training, and George and I were talking about it. We were expecting maybe an hour, something simple. Okay, here we are, Browns Ferry, nuclear power plant. We got to get trained on how to go into a nuclear plant. This will be cool. This is Bill Ball. Bill was introduced to nuclear power at the plant where his dad worked. He then went into the Navy with nuclear submarines, and now he runs a team at Browns Ferry that's in charge of making make sure the plant is operational. This is my longtime buddy, Phillip. We've known each other forever. He's been on my phone for over a decade simply as Neutron because he works at the nuclear plant and have always wanted to see what he does. What are we doing today? [Bill] Well, today we got to get you set up for a rad worker training, essentially, is what it boils down to. We got to test you. We're going to train you and test you a bunch so we can get you some dosimetry so we can get you in the plant to see what you want to see. [D] Okay, so I've got to get one of these on, like a dosimeter? [Bill] Yes, sir. [D] Okay, cool. Sounds good. And you're going to do it? [Philip] I'll be around. [D] So Is Philip going to be my escort? Is that how we're going to do it? [B] I'm your escort right now. Philip is going to help, too. Us two will be getting you around the plant or around the training center. [D] Okay, sounds great. [B] These are badges. These are for you. Thank you. So get you in and out of here. I just need those back when we're done for the day, please. [D] Bill really spearheaded getting us into the plant. They both work in the instrumentation department at the plant, and you'll get to know them a lot more as we go. We made our way down to a classroom where we were introduced to a guy named Roger, who was in charge of our training. [R] Give you all some CBT training today. For your dress out before. It's the prerequisite for your dress out. I just want to talk about the radiation worker process, checking in and all that stuff, and explain the nuclear fission process and things like that to you, okay? [D] Okay, sounds good. [R] You guys pick a computer out here. [D] Sweet. [R] I got you. [D] Are we actually going to dress out today? No, I probably won't get to that today because this training here will take between 4-6 hours. [D] Okay. [R] So we'll get that done today and then have you a dress out class schedule for in the morning, first thing. I've had the opportunity to visit some very incredible places. And usually once you meet the security criteria and a certain person signs your badge or whatever, you can go in. It's not a big deal. This was very, very different because I had to take training and it wasn't just like, oh, sit down and let us talk to you for a few minutes. We're talking hours and hours and hours of computer-based training that we had to go through in order to get access to this place. And they gave us an exam. We had to take an exam to make sure we could do it. This was far more intense than I expected. This was just day one of training. So I didn't understand what I was getting into at all. And that fascinated me. It made me realize this is a different thing than anything I've ever done. I learned so much in this training. We even looked at the core of the reactor and how that works. And there's one thing that stuck out with me in particular that helped me understand radiation itself and all the different ways radiation happens. So I want to show you this, and we're going to run through it, and then I'm going to show you it again one more time, okay? So nuclear fission. We talked about this in the first episode. Uranium-235 splits into multiple atoms. And when it does that, there's this release of a tremendous amount of energy, right? But we didn't really talk about the radiation that's released as well, but that's also a thing. So we have this event, and we have these daughter products of uranium-235 splitting, but we also have radiation. And what they do in a nuclear plant is they control the areas where this radiation happens, and it's called the radiologically controlled area, the RCA. In the RCA, there's multiple types of radiation that can affect biological life and cells in your body, and they control them in different ways. Let's talk about the four types of radiation. The first one I want to talk about is called alpha. Alpha radiation happens when the components off these atoms fly off and you get something that looks like the nucleus of a helium atom, right? Two protons, two neutrons. So it's really big. Got to look excited with the model. There's an extra neutron. Pretend that's not there. And it can fly off, but it's easy to stop. It can be stopped by something as simple as paper. So if this alpha radiation comes in contact with paper, it stops, which is cool because This means we can use anything thicker than paper to shield against alpha particles in our radiologically controlled area. The second type of radiation is called beta radiation. Now, beta decay usually is like an electron or even a positron. Okay, so these electrons fly off, but they can fly right through paper. They go all the way, but plastic can stop them, right? So you can't stop beta with paper. You can stop it with plastic, though, which is why, I think this is very interesting, you'll see people in nuclear plants wearing safety glasses, and it's not that they're trying to protect from cutting things with a saw or anything like that. They're literally wearing safety glasses because this plastic, this polycarbonate right here, can stop beta radiation. It's very interesting. Beta It's bad to get in your body. You don't want to ingest it. You don't want it in your eyes, things like that. So beta is something that you can stop with something as simple as plastic. The third type of radiation that I want to look at, I think is probably the most interesting to me, and that's gamma radiation. Gamma radiation is not a particle. It's a wave, a very high frequency wave. It's higher frequency even than X-rays. It can go through paper like it's nothing. It can go through plastic, all the way through plastic. It It goes all the way, and you're typically going to want to stop Gamma with something like lead. You know how when you go to the dentist and they put this lead apron on you to stop the X-rays? Well, Gamma is higher frequency than X-rays, and it can penetrate things like X-rays, but even more energetic. So it has to be stopped with something like lead. Okay, so we have alpha, beta, gamma. There's another one that's fascinating, and that is neutron radiation. Do you remember in the first episode we talked about this little guy? Wee, little fast neutron. Well, neutron radiation comes off of this event, and they're very, very fast, and they can go through all kinds of stuff. They're going to go past your paper, past your plastic, even lead. They usually have to be stopped by concrete, specifically concrete that has a high water content. An interesting thing about neutron radiation is it interacts with hydrogen atoms quite a bit, and that slows it down. And so if we had water, you could slow down neutrons with water. And So the people that work in a radiologically controlled area, they understand all the physics associated with Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Neutron radiation, and they can control the environment by different types of shielding. And I think that's fascinating. So what I want to do real quick is I want to show you, just with one still shot right here, I want to show you where these different types of radiation stop. Because when I took this training, this is the visual that stuck in my mind, okay? So for alpha radiation, it can be stopped by paper. For beta radiation, it's going to be stopped by plastic after it goes through that paper. And for gamma radiation, it can go straight through paper, straight through plastic. It can be stopped by something like lead. For neutron radiation, it interacts with hydrogen atoms, and so it can be slowed down by water, or in the absence of water, it can be stopped by something like concrete. This is how radiation is controlled in what's called the radiologically controlled area. This is how they shield against that kinda stuff. All of this describes radiation, which is a very different concept from another word that's very similar in my mind, contamination. These two things are different, and Philip has a pretty interesting analogy to explain the difference. Yeah, the crudest way that was explained to me, but it stuck with me is if you imagine your dog makes a mess in the yard, if you walk up to it, you can smell it. It is affecting you, but you can walk away from it. However, if you were to step in it and then you track it in the house, now it is affecting all over the place. You are contaminated and you're spreading contamination. [D] Makes sense. Okay, trust me on this. I bought a plastic pile of dog poop to demonstrate this, and then I realized this is an important concept, and I want to learn this exactly once and never forget it. So we're going all in. All right, this This is my friend's dog, Duchess. Duchess, come here. Good girl. All right, here we go. Please forgive me for this analogy, but I think this is going to work. I have a very complicated setup here. I have multiple boards, and we're about to learn about contamination versus radiation. Okay, so I have some contamination right here, right? This is contamination. I don't like it. I do not like this at all. Notice how I take this glove off. That's going to be important later. So right now in this room, there is a smell radiating from this dog poop right now. It's awful. I don't like it. I'm a little sad of my life choices. However, there's a smell coming off. How do I know that? How do I know that there's a smell happening that's unpleasant? And the answer is, I have a nose. And that nose is a detector that I'm using to detect that smell that's radiating from dog poop, right? But what about this radiation right here? We have this unstable atom that has some radiation that's coming off of it. It looks like it's Gamma. How do we know where that is? I don't have a detector on my body that can tell me that. By the time I can feel it or anything, it's way too late, okay? So radiation workers, or I guess nuclear workers is the proper term, have a very special thing called a dosimeter. This is a DAD, a digital alarming dosimeter. And the way that my nose sends a signal to my brain that says, Hey, something's bad, and it's probably poop, that isn't in my body. But what this does is it makes a noise with a little speaker, and I can hear that, and that tells me, Oh, I might be around radiation. So This digital alarming dosimeter detects the radiation coming away from those nuclear atoms, whatever that is. Okay, so let's say that I want to do some form of work in a nuclear plant in a special room. I'm in this room and I want to go in here and do something. Oh, but there's a problem. I've got a pipe and there's water flowing in the pipe, but there seems to be some type of radioactive particles that have collected in the bottom of this valve. Do you see that? Okay, well, that's probably not a great place to go in there. So how do I know if I can come in the room or not? How do I know if it's safe for me to go in? Let's just hide in the safe area first. How do I know? Well, let's think about it. So if we have If we have different types of radiation coming off of these isotopes, then let's think about what we can do. We have Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Neutron. Well, we're not going to worry about Neutron because that's mostly in the core of the reactor. So let's don't think about that right now. So Alpha stops at paper, beta stops at plastic. So we don't have to worry about them because they're contained in the steel pipe. But think about this gamma. This gamma could probably go through that steel pipe because you need something heavy like lead to stop it, right? So let's look at our little dog poop What can we do to prevent the smell? Oh, here's the thing we could do. We could put a little cover over the dog poop so the smell could no longer get to us. And since we know that lead stops gamma, we could do what we talked about earlier, right? We've got that lead blanket from the dentist office. You remember that? So is there a way we could wrap lead around this area of the pipe that has contamination in it to protect us in the room? And actually there is. You can just wrap that entire pipe pipe with lead, and suddenly it prevents Gamma from getting out into the room and it protects the person. So just like we were able to shield the dog poop to get over here, if we put lead over that radiation like that, then we can prevent the Gamma from getting over here to where we are. So that's a really interesting technique. So that's the first way that a nuclear worker can protect themselves in a room with contamination. They can use shielding which is very interesting. They are now shielded from that radiation. Well, what's the other thing we do? All right, let's go back and look at our turd analogy here. So if I had to do some work around this dog poop and I got close, the closer I get, the more uncomfortable I feel. And you can see it with the nose, even. If I come in close, oh, man, it smells so bad. I got to get away. If I change my distance, then I can keep myself safe. So I wouldn't want to do any work over here. I would want to work here if I can control that, right? So that's the second way that a nuclear worker can protect themselves from radiation or contamination is keeping your distance from the source, okay? So we got shielding and distance. And what's the third thing we would do? If I had to work around that dog poop right there, man, it smells bad in this room. I would want to get out of the room as quickly as possible. So that's another thing we can do. We can just go over, do our work, and get out of there really fast. So that's fine. I'm going to do it again. Get in there, get out. That's called time. So shielding Shielding distance time. Those are the three tools that nuclear workers have to protect themselves from radiation. And this actually has a name. It's a program that's called, We want to keep our radiation exposure as low as reasonably achievable. And they call that inside the plant, they call that the ALARA program. So basically, nuclear workers want to limit their exposure by applying shielding, keeping their distance, and limiting the amount that they are around any nuclear source, which I think is really interesting. And if you think about it, that works with the way things work here. Man, I just want to get out of this room. But, oh, no. Okay. Oh, goodness. This is a big deal. So we no longer just have to think about the radiation. We now have contamination because that water was in that pipe where those radioactive particles were, and now it's dripped on the floor. So if we have to do any work in there, this could happen. We could walk over here, we could do our work, but on our way out, there's a very high likelihood that we might actually track that stuff out. And because it was from that pipe with the particles in it, we could spread that contamination. This is a big deal, and we have to think about what to do here. We need to call somebody. So that's what happens in a nuclear plant. If there's a spill or anything like that, biggest of deals, you have to deal with it, and you have to deal with it in a very intelligent way. So you call these special people. They come out with special meters, and they check everything, and they have special equipment sometimes that they'll come, and they'll clean everything up, and they'll make sure that everything's safe. So that work can continue. One of the things that's very important, the whole area of the nuclear plant has an inner area inside it that's called the radiologically controlled area. I think I referenced that earlier. This is a very special concept. It's like a section of the plant that's contained, and every individual source is located and quantified for its radiological effects. And so before you go into a plant, you have to check with the authorities, and they tell you, okay, if you're going to that area, there's a special valve over there that's hot, so you need to keep your distance or limit your time around it. This concept of the RCA is very, very important for ALARA because that's how they control where everything is. And so if there's a spill and it changes the area. They document all that in the RCA documentation, and you know where to go and what to do when you're there. So these are the main concepts that I learned in that training, and it was really good training, actually. There was a lot of numbers that went along with it. We got to learn how the core of the reactor worked, which I really enjoyed. But the last thing is you have to take an exam. Now, I'm an engineer. I felt pretty confident about my ability to hang with all this stuff. I think I get it. George, however, theater major. A little concerned about George's ability to get all this right, so I was a little nervous for George. Let's go see how he did. [G] What did you get? [R] Click on review. [D] What do you mean what I get? Don't even worry about it. [G] Review your results. [D] I got a 92. What did you get? [G] 96. [D] You beat me. [G] I got that one wrong too. [D] We got it. High five. Years ago, I reached out to a company and I said, Hey, what you're doing is amazing. Would you please consider sponsoring Smarter Every Day? Because I want to tell people about what you're doing. And that's Kiwi Co. Kiwi Co sends these boxes to your house. They call them crates. And these crates come with instructions and all kinds of hardware inside. Everything a child needs to make a really cool project is in this box, and it will help them learn, and it's awesome. This is my daughter. My daughter loves building things. She loves art, and she loves working with her hands. And today, I'm going to give her the light up infinity mirror, which is part of the Kiwi Co Labs line of crates. And she's going to give her best shot at making a circuit for the first time. And I'm really excited about it. The cool thing about this project is it involves optics, electronics. It even has some mechanical gears and stuff in there. She hasn't done a lot of this stuff. If it doesn't work, you flip back a couple of pages and you find where you messed up and you fix it. I love that about Kiwi Co, and the kids love it too, because when you get done, you've got this thing that you built. So this infinity mirror, for example, check Check this out. I'm so grateful for Kiwi Co because all of my kids have learned different things through Kiwi Co throughout the years. There's five different Kiwi Co clubs you can pick from. There's Panda, Sprout, there's Labs with three different age groups in Labs, there's World and Studio, and you can tailor the Kiwi Co experience to the interest of the child you love. You are smart. I know that about you. You know that about you. And you can tell when somebody's telling you the truth. I have been loyal to Kiwi Co for years because it's a great product. I only work with products that I believe in, and that's important to me. So if you would like to check this out, it'll be good for your family or a kid you love, go to kiwico.com/smarter. That gets you 50% off your first month on monthly lines, and it supports Smarter Every Day when you consider supporting the sponsor. So thank you so much for doing that, kiwico.com/smarter. We came back the next day to a warehouse on site that housed more hands-on training, and we met Tim Lawson. Tim is what's an RP instructor, Radiation Protection. I learned that RP professionals in nuclear plants are very important. They're like the watchdogs or the scouts that are constantly looking around the plant to keep the workforce safe from radiation. Tim briefed us on something called an RWP or Radiological Work Permit. These are very, very important. Anything that happens in the plant, you first have to get an RWP, and you have to be given specific instructions about what you're going to do, what your radiation limits are while you're there. It's a very important guide that people use anytime they enter the RCA or radiologically controlled area. [Tim] Here we have an RWP, and this will be the RWP we'll be using today going through out So it is all units, reactor building, general area activities. This RWP has medium radiological risk, and the RWP set points are 80 millirem for the dose alarm and 80 millirem per hour for the dose rate alarm. This unit that the RWP says millirem, I have no frame of reference for what that means at this point. And a little bit later, Tim explained the scale of millirem. I'll just let you listen to that now. You see negligible effects before 50,000 millirem, 50,000 millirem. The stations, the NRC's limit is 5,000 millirem, but then the station lowers that to the maximum of 2,000 millirem. So your threshold for any biological effects is 50,000 millirem, and we are so far below that. Have you ever seen a fundraiser where the town will put a big thermometer out in town square, and as people donate, it'll fill up the thermometer? Well, this is how I think about the dosage limits you're allowed working at a nuclear plant. So Tim just said that 50,000 millirem is what's required in order for biological effects to happen to your body, right? Now, in this case, that's way in the sky. That's off the board, okay? I'm looking at 2000 millirem, which is what's allowable at Browns Ferry nuclear power plant. And this is how I think it works. So first of all, as a human on Earth, you are going to be exposed to radiation just as a function of being on Earth. That's cosmic rays and stuff like that hitting you. You're going to get radiation just in the background of your everyday life. But because you are a nuclear worker that works at a nuclear plant, and today you're going to get a radiological work permit, an RWP, and you're going to read it and you're going to say, Oh, well, today I can get 80 millirem, and my dose rate alarm is 80 millirem. So what that means is I can go into the plant and I can do my work, and that's my limit. So let's say I went and I did my work and I got like 35 millirem, okay? Well, I would just add that to my little thermometer and Tomorrow you do it and you got maybe 40. And so you do this over and over and over and it's cumulative. The amount of radiation you're exposed to over the course of a year adds up. But let's say tomorrow you are required to go work in a different part of the plant that has a hotspot. There's more radiation there, and you might get more radiation than typical. Well, that's okay. As long as the RWP allows it, you're allowed to get that dosage of radiation. So this goes up, up, up, and they keep up with how much radiation each individual worker receives over the course of their job. Now, there's two ways that nuclear workers can measure this. The first way is called a DAD, a digital alarming dosimeter. Now, a DAD is pretty interesting. It works like an old-school Pager that measures radiation. Now, I'm assuming it measures Gamma. I don't really know, but it's pretty interesting how it works because it's doing two things. It's measuring a rate, meaning on my RWP, it says I can get 80 millirem per hour. So basically, the rate at which the thermometer is going up, that's what this measures. There's another thing you can use, and that's called the dosimeter of legal record. Now, this one works a little differently. A dosimeter of legal record looks like this. It's like a little thing that you wear, like a name tag-looking thing. And this thing measures the cumulative effects of being exposed to radiation. So a DLR, basically how that works is you wear it for three months And then after that or some unit of time, you send it in to get measured, and they can look at it and they can say, Oh, you got this much radiation in that time period. I'm assuming it's like some film in there, and they'll measure how much the film was exposed, something like that. Not sure how it works. But these are the two tools that you can use to figure out how much radiation each worker is exposed to. So a DAD, a digital alarming dosimeter that gives you the rate, and you can use math to figure out what the total dosage that you've received is, and a DLR, a dosimeter of legal record. That gets you just the totals over a certain period of time. All this is meant to give you an ALARA compliance, the as low as reasonably achievable goal. So these are not amounts of radiation you receive on that RWP. This is the upper limit. You don't want to go over these numbers. And a really good radiation worker, somebody that works in a nuclear plant that's really good at their job, they will keep this number as low as possible, which I think is really interesting. Now, I understand I understand all this, but what I don't have a feel for is, what do these numbers mean? Like 2,000 millirem? How does that compare to other things? So I asked him, how does this compare to other professions? Like radiation techs or people that are working in the medical field that are doing X-rays all day. How does this nuclear program for ALARA, how does that measure against other fields? And his response was pretty funny. [T] The medical field, that scares the hell out me. What those people do with their isotopes is, man, they need the NRC on them. But they're not regulated by the NRC, we are. So both of my sons work here. I feel like it is one of the... Which is near and dear to me. I feel like it is absolutely safe enough to where my children can be here and have a very good career. And it's a good place to be. You're absolutely protected. [D] After we finish our classwork, it was time to head next door for hands-on training. So the RP people in a nuclear plant, you're like the mother may I. If I need to do something, I need to check to make sure that the area is safe, you guys have the equipment, you know how to clear an area. Is that correct? Yeah, that's correct. So what we'll do is we have a frequency of surveying every zone. So like the Marines, we go first every time. If it needs lighting in an area that's dark, you go in with a headlamp on and your meter, which tells you the radiation because you can't see it, smell it, or taste it. So we go in with our meters, we go in in the dark, we monitor for conditions. When we have those conditions, we come out and we tell the person who's going to go in and hang the lights. Hey, here's where the radiation is at, here's where the hazards are at, and here's where you are allowed to go, and here's where you need to avoid because these are dangers which are going to exceed your radiation work permit. It exceeds the limits which we allow. And so what you're about to do is you're about to test me on my my ability to follow procedures, and I'm either going to pass or I'm going to fail, right? That is correct. Before we went into the mockup of the radiologically controlled area, I had to learn how to get checked in with a software system that tracks workers and their RWPs and the dosages as they enter and exit the RCA. I got my two mockup dosimeters and reviewed our RWP. [T] Click yes, you've acknowledged that you have read and understand that when you do [D] dose alarm, 40 millirem, and so that's how much I can be exposed. [T] No, that's much you can receive. [D] That's how much I can receive, thank you. And the maximum rate that this is going to alarm at is 80 millilrem an hour. [T] Right. So if you walk into 80 millilrem an hour, it's going to alarm while you're standing in the 80 millirem an hour. And as it accrues 10 millirem, 15 millirem, 20 millirem. If it gets to 40, it's going to alarm, and it's not going to stop alarming, and you're going to have to exit and see RP. [D] Got it. [T] To prevent that, we look at our dosimeter every 10 to 15 minutes while we're inside of a radiation area, and then that's going to activate the dosimeter, and it gives you your allowable set point. So right now, the station allows you two rem, like we discussed, but it's only going to give you 40 millirem for this single entry. Even though you have nearly two rem, you can still only pick up 40 millirem for this single entry. [D] Tim then showed me how the turn styles work off of your dosimeter. And then I got dressed out according to the specifications laid out in the RWP with boots and gloves and a head covering. Tim talked me through the security door and the airlock procedures, and we headed into the mockup area, and I was a little bit worried that I would forget stuff from the RWP. But Tim reminded me that I have a little white trip ticket that the computer gave me when I logged in that had all the stuff listed out for me. [T] Your trip ticket t",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lls you how much dose you can accumulate and how much dose you can walk into. So you have that on your trip ticket. So the only thing you have to really have in your head is what the conditions are inside of this contaminated area. And as we discussed on the briefing, here's a survey map here. So we see that just inside the step off pad is two millirem an hour here, and I don't reach across the boundary. It's two millilrem an hour right there. It's five millirem right over here. It's 8 to 10 over by the high radiation area on one side, and it's 8 to 10 down that side of the high radiation area. Noticing the boundary is continuous, and it's a continuous boundary so that no one accidentally walks into an area while they're just looking up at something else because a lot of people walk in a plant inspecting, so they have other things on their mind other than where the boundary is at. So that's a continuous boundary. So you're going in to check the following unit IDs. So I've got a list of IDs that you're going to look at. I would look at my dosimeter and make sure it was turned on before I went into the area. [D] Okay. [T] Still, because we do have digital issues like the world does. [D] Okay, the dosimeter is on. When I first walked into the mockup, I was being tested, right? I wasn't thinking about making a video. But after the fact, I realized this is interesting, and I asked if I could take my camera back in there, and I filmed things from my perspective so you could see it. So I edited this together so you could get an idea of what I was looking at while Tim was showing me things. So you'll get the idea. But I apologize for not filming this the best. All right. [T] So you'll notice there's not a barrier here, as we discussed, like the high radiation area, which is a yield sign, which is a caution. So there's no barrier here. And the only way in or out is across It's a step off pad. Okay, this gets interesting pretty fast. So this is the map of the area that I'm going to be operating in, right? You can see we have a large contaminated area or the radiation area. And up here in the corner, we have a high radiation area. So what I'm supposed to do as I enter right here is I go to the low dosage waiting area immediately. I misread this map right off the get go, and I immediately walked all the way across, and I thought this was the low dosage waiting area right over here this pipe, and I just hung out there, which was the wrong thing to do. So yeah, that's how I started. I started off wrong. [T] So you're looking for... Label number one is unit ID 2-pmp, which is for pump, 2-pmp-075-0020-cs drain pump alpha. [D] So I'm just using my eyes. I'm seeing a pump over there. I'm not going there yet. I'm just trying map out where I'm going because I want to be there for a minimum amount of time. [T] Yes. [D] I'm going to go over. [T] You're just going to verify the ID. [D] No, that's the RAD water pump. [T] Hey, that wrench is not supposed to be there. Can you grab that wrench? [D] I will not grab that wrench. That is very good! That's exactly... Now, why wouldn't you? [D] Because that's the high radiation area, and my RP won't let me. [T] Hey, would you straighten that hose, if you don't mind? [D] That hose in the back there? [T] Yes. [D] Okay. I'm thinking, I can't really get there without a stick or something. [T] Right, yeah. So you don't want to do it. You don't want to cross the FMA barrier. And a stick in the FME barrier, as we discussed, is foreign material exclusion. So we don't- [D] Can't use a stick. [T] Well, you want to be... Yeah, you want to log and document everything that goes into- [D] Every tool that passes the barrier. [T] Correct. [D] Okay. Tim continued to ask me to do different things and look at stuff in the environment, and these were basically ways to distract me. And so he would try to ask me to do something that would break radiation protocol, and he would if I would catch it. And so it was fun. When George and another TVA employee went through this exercise, I got to watch, and you'll notice that they're waiting in the correct low dosage waiting area. So there's that. This training helped us piece together a lot of the information in our heads into a simple set of behavior rules that would minimize our radiation exposure. [T] So shielding. So that's shielding. [D] That's temporary shielding. [T] That is temporary shielding, and that is lead. So what if we had to do maintenance on that valve? Could you remove that lead shielding? [D] I'm assuming if I got permission in my RWP, but it's not in my RWP. [T] It's not. To remove lead shielding, RP would have to be present standing there, because as you remove that shielding, the dose rates are going to increase. [D] Okay, so you would have to monitor as I remove the shielding. Correct. RP would have to be here. It would have to be as you remove it would be there. That's correct. [D] Tim had me follow the procedures for taking off my protective gear, which had to be done in a very specific way in order to minimize possible contamination. Okay. [T] Now, I'll note this. When you pulled it off, it came out past the line here. [D] Don't do that. [T] If it had something on the bottom of it, it would sling it onto the clean area. Like I said, this is the most likely area to get a clean area contamination because of the migration. Like the dirt that will be on your shoe when it's sprung, it'll spring out onto the clean air. [D] So I just rubber band shot a potential hazard that way. [T] So what I like to do is, and it's just a technique, is as I undress, I face inward, and I pull everything off inward. And then like a doctor would back up to a door. [D] I finished taking off my protective gear and exited the radiation area, and then he had me scan myself for possible contamination, which again was supposed to be done in a very specific way, which I remember from the written test, but struggled to do it in terms of a practical application. He then took me over and showed me how I would exit the RCA, which entailed having a full body scan done. And then, of course, I checked back out with my dosimeter with the software system. Obviously, I'd messed up the low dosage waiting area, but it was time for Tim to give me his final feedback. [T] I did have to coach you on the speed of what you were frisking. So that was one thing. I got you on a second attempt, though, once I told you you knew the speed. So you didn't check your dosimeter while you were inside of the area. Oh, that's So you didn't look at it. [D] That's a big deal. [T] Well, it's the first indicator that dose rates are not what you expect them to be. You did a perfect job on Dressout. You used all the tools that were available to you. I mean, your dose your bank account for your life, and you kept it ALARA. [D] I was so distracted by the task. [T] Sure. [D] I didn't think about the radiation. I was thinking about it because of the map. I was seeing the map in my head, but I wasn't thinking about what I was actually receiving at the moment. [T] That's a great point for why radiation protection concentrates solely on radiation protection. Just like security, when they're walking around the plant, they're looking for guilty people. They're looking for holes in the system. They're not thinking radiation. Maintenance guys, they're looking for leaks and steam, and they're wondering, why is that line hot when it shouldn't be hot? That's their focus. Our focus is strictly radiation. [D] Well, yeah. Well, that was a great real-world scenario. I really appreciate the time. Thank you so much for teaching me. [T] Absolutely. You're You did a good job. Now, when I submit this paper, you will be fully qualified, okay? [D] Okay, we are now certified. We have moved from knowledge about nuclear plants to understanding. We're about to go into the plant, and Bill is going to say a lot of things as he takes us in, but you now know what these terms mean. So listen to what he says and see if you know what's going on. [BILL] All right, so here's what we're going to do. We're going to go in the RCA. You're going to put your DAD on here. Phil will go in last. Just make sure you're all good. You get the green light and we'll go in. Okay. Now you got your hard hat, safety glasses, hearing protection, DOR, and your DAD, right? [D] Yes, sir. Good to go. Great. Currently, I have zero Milliram. [B] Okay, so what I'm about to take you into is the secondary containment area, right? You'll notice that there's some locked doors and everything like water tight doors. We do this intentionally because this is our absolute last means if something bad happened, that's where we keep it all. We keep this area at a negative pressure just to make sure we keep all the containment products inside secondary containment if something were to have happened. We're going to walk up to the elevator through the operating spaces because there's less traffic over this way. [PHIL] Before we go any farther, when you see the floor drains, don't step on those. They're a lot of times contaminated. [D] Okay so be looking for floor drains. Can you believe this? We're in a nuclear plant as a part of the nuclear power deep dive series. I am so incredibly excited. I'm going to show you something. It doesn't seem like it could be real. It's real. This is where we're going in the next video. We're going to go over an open reactor core. As they refuel it, you're going to be right there on a bridge on top of this thing, and we're going to get to look down into the reactor core. It is so incredibly fascinating. Now that we understand the radiation and how contamination works, you're going to understand what it's like to walk through the plant, and we're going to see how that reactor works, and we're going to understand it. It's so fascinating. So a big thanks to everybody that supports Smarter Every Day over at Patreon. You make this happen. So very excited about this. If you would like to be notified when the next video in the nuclear power series comes out, I've got an email list You can go to smartereveryday.com and just fill out the email list thing there, and I will send you an email when the video comes out. But we have so much to learn as a part of this series. We still have so much to learn at Idaho National Labs. There's so many things that go into making nuclear power happen, and it's fascinating. So I'm excited you're here with me because I'm grateful that I get to learn this, and I get to learn it with you. And that's really cool. We get to do this together, and it's fun. So big thanks to TVA and Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant for allowing us to do this. I'm grateful. I'm learning so much. So yeah," consider subscribing to Smarter Every Day if you haven't done that. And I'll see you on the next nuclear power deep dive video. That's it. I'm Destin. You're getting Smarter Every Day. Have a good one.

3ZTGwcHQfLY,I Tried To Make Something In America (The Smarter Scrubber Experiment) - Smarter Every Day 308,,Educational,"Is it possible to make something in America and be competitive in the marketplace? This video documents an experiment that lasted over four years. The goal was simple, to manufacture a product here in America. The challenge is that almost every single market force pushes manufacturing to make things overseas. What happens if you ignore those pressures and you just make something here anyways? This channel is supported by the patrons of Smarter Every Day. Their financial contributions are what allowed to do this experiment, and I think it's very important. The global economic forces that have shaped the world since World War II are changing, and I believe people in your community who understand how to manufacture things are going to be even more critical in the coming years. My home is here in America, but this video's lessons doesn't just apply to America. It's wherever you live. If you can manufacture things locally, then that ensures your self-reliance, your stability, and ultimately, your freedom. Let's explore this topic and go get Smarter Every Day. I started this process with the goal of making everything you see here in America. All of these components go together to make one thing, and that thing is a grill scrubber. This is called the Smarter Scrubber, and we'll talk more about that later. But for now, I want to tell you how we're going to lay this video out. There's three parts to this video. The first part is why I wanted to do it. Why did I want to perform this experiment? Secondly, how it happened. Every component there has a story. I want to tell you the story of each of those components. And finally, I want to pitch you on buying that product. I want you to buy it, not because you're watching some YouTube video, but is it actually competitive in the market? Is this a thing that can exist on its own in the marketplace? I'm going to give you that pitch and we'll see. Part one, why? Both my mom and my dad were union auto workers. United United Auto Workers, 2195, here locally in North Alabama. They made steering components for vehicles. My mom worked on the assembly line. My dad was in tool and gage. When they would come home, they would smell like cutting fluid, and that smelled like work to me. It smelled like productivity. They made things. And everybody that I knew, their parents made things. Middle class America. The American dream was alive and well. And then things changed. With NAFTA and CAFTA, it wasn't one political party. It was everybody. Globally, things were changing so that it made more sense economically to move manufacturing facilities out of the United States. And that's exactly what happened. This is more than Destin is upset because NAFTA took mommy and daddy's job. I don't even know that NAFTA did take mommy and daddy's job. I think things were changing before that. So the global economy is so complicated. I could make a whole channel on it, but what I want to do is just take 60 seconds to demonstrate that I understand this is a complex topic, and I just want to throw some ideas out there and let you think about it, and then we're going to move on with this video. But it's just a really interesting thing to think about. Okay, so a long time ago, things were better, right? That's called golden age thinking. Every civilization has done that. The idea that if we could just to return to the way the things were, things would be better. That's a powerful, nostalgic thing, but it's not really accurate. Because if you think about it, we went from this type of shipping to this type of shipping in 150 years. And that is analogous to the complexities of global trade, because wars were fought when we were using wooden boats. Imagine how complex the economics are when you go to boats like this with containerized shipping. In World War II, the Bretton Woods Accords in New Hampshire, America decided they were going to guarantee the shipping lanes would be open so global trade and global prosperity could happen. We started doing that. Everybody started doing good things. And then people started exploiting cheap labor in developing nations, and then profit became king. And so now we have billionaires, and we have a wage gap, and it's very complicated. And so people are pushing factories overseas, and it's good for local communities overseas, but sometimes it's not. Okay, so that was impossible. I didn't even mention unions, collective bargaining agreements, all that stuff. It's a very complicated issue. And I'm not like, America is dominant and must be. No, that's not what I care about. I care about people. I love people. And I think these issues are more than something that can be distilled down to a one-line that you can use to dunk on people who differ with your views politically. This is complicated. And we, as people have to solve it because we're not agrarian anymore. We have industrialization that can make food, so we must produce things as people, not just in America, everywhere. I just don't want people to be exploited in the process. My answer to all of this is Jesus, the golden rule, do unto others as you would have them do unto you. But we have to figure this out. Let's move on with the video. I remember this period of time not understanding how important these global shifts, literally, were changing the town around me. I become an engineer. I learned how to draft and draw parts that hopefully would be manufactured sometime in America. But then when I got out of school, there were not many plants to go work at. Fast forward a lot of stuff, and then you'll get to the 2020 global pandemic. The 2020 pandemic made a lot of people mad for a lot of reasons. It made me mad. I don't get mad very often, but it did make me mad because of manufacturing capacity in America. So when everything went down, Everybody wanted N95 masks and face shields, and they couldn't get it. When the President starts talking about airplane shipments from China, because that's the only place we can get these N95 masks, I realized this is a big deal. We can't make the things we need. And I'm not talking about the mask debate. Imagine, if we're talking about individual airplanes coming from China, do you think Alabama is on the priority list of where those things get distributed? No, we weren't. And so as a local community, we decided we're going to 3D print masks for our medical workers the N95 masks, the face shields, and stuff like that. A guy in California had developed this system to do this safely, so we did. We came together. It was a really good community moment. We 3D printed these things, but we realized very quickly this is slow and very difficult. We need to be able to manufacture things. And so I started trying to find where I could manufacture these things. And this revealed to me how anemic our manufacturing capacity in America has become, because I was waiting on some billionaire to come save us, and it didn't happen. You know what happened? I went and found a guy guy here locally in Alabama. His name is Chris Robeson. He knew how to make an injection mold, and he did. We worked together and we created an injection mold here in Alabama. This is the model number Huntsville 02 made in Alabama face shield. This is what was distributed here in Alabama to our medical workers. You put a little piece of plastic over there, and we used this in hospitals all over the state and even in adjacent states. So this whole pandemic made me realize that our our manufacturing capacity in America has been gutted. If Chris had decided to retire before I needed that mold made, we would not have been able to make an injection mold in my area. And this made me mad. I realized the knowledge chain almost broke, so I made this tweet asking about how I would find local manufacturers in order to make things in America. That's what I realized had to happen, and so I started on the journey. All right, I'm going to pause here and introduce you to the last, probably most important person of the story that you need to know before we get going, John Youngblood. John owns a small business named JJ George that sells grill products. There's a ton of problems with grill brushes on the market. We'll get into those later. But John had a very clever idea to solve these problems with chain mail. Now, I got excited about his idea, and I wanted to get involved as an engineer and just help him in general, so we decided to work together. I tagged along as John presented his idea at a roundtable discussion of local business owners. The problem is that every product out there that's a grill scraper is mediocre at best. I know I'm buying a disposable product, maybe one a season. John got to start by making wooden grill tables right here in the USA, but he's also worked with people overseas to make other grill accessories. John was experiencing pain because of that. I don't know if you realize this, but as a small business, if you have an idea and you get it made overseas, that's cool, but they have all the tooling to make the thing that you wanted made. So at night, they can literally just crank up the machine, make more of them less high-quality products, and they can just counter-sell against you on Amazon, and you have no recourse. There's nothing you could do. This is one of John's best-selling products on Amazon, at least it used to be, because look at all of these knock-offs. They're everywhere. The interesting thing about this is John has a patent, and he's tried to get these other things taken down off of Amazon, but he's found it almost impossible to get Amazon to respond in a timely manner. It's like playing Whac-a-Mole. Look at all these letters he had to get lawers to write. That's a lot of money. The interesting thing is, Amazon almost tells these manufacturers overseas what to knock off. If you go to the product page, you can see how many were sold in the last month, and all they have to do is say, Oh, look, that one sells 3,000 units a month. That's clearly what I want to pirate. So these product pirates go and they'll take a really good product like his grill torch, and they'll just knock it off. And parts of it are exactly the same. Other parts of it are a little different because they want to make it cheaper. Like, for example, on John's unit, there is a removable screw that allows you to take the tube off in the event that a dirt dover gets in there or something. Not on the other unit, there's nothing like that. It's glued in position. You just have to throw it away. It's weird because they're selling this for half the price, but at the same time, they're taking all the business and they're making lower-quality products. Not only does this mean counterfeit goods for buyers, look at what sellers are saying in Amazon's own seller forum. Amazon's inability to police this, or at worst, unwillingness to prioritize it, that's destroying small businesses and manufacturers in America who depend on the very idea of intellectual property to protect them from fraud. So this is one of the main reasons why John wanted to work with me. I wanted to work with him because I wanted to make something, and he knows the business side, but he wanted to work with me so we could use the YouTube channel to tell people about the product and not have to sell it on Amazon. So again, Amazon, do on to others as you would have them do on to you. Let's get to part two of the video. How did we build this thing? To understand why we have all these parts, let's think about the problem we're trying to solve. We have grill grates, and we're trying to scrub it with chain mail, right? So in order to do that, we need the chain mail to be compliant around those bars. So we want to apply downward pressure. To do that, we need something squishy behind the chain mail that when we push it down, it wraps those chain mail links around those grates. So I figured out that in order to attach the chain mail and the rubber part to a handle, we were going to have a problem because the Squishy part would break. So what we need is some type of adapter that could go between the Squishy and the handle, and then that way you could move the whole thing and it would all work as one. So that's how we did all this. And I learned from the pandemic that the key to making things fast is injection molding. I covered injection molding in the MVP Disk Golf disk video. You have two parts of a metal mold, and you clamp them together so that they have a cavity in the center, the shape of the part you want. You then inject molten plastic into that void and let it solidify, and then you open the mold and you kick out the part. That's injection molding. So I started the design process. And for an engineer, you just start in CAD and you start drawing stuff. I started making things and started figuring out how to get a rubbery backing, and I ended up with a really nice history of all the designs right here. It's kinda fun to look at. I knew that I had to design it so that it could be molded and made and then ultimately assembled. I'm a little embarrassed showing you all this stuff. In some of the earlier designs, I had these little posts because I had to hold the chain the chain mail around the rubber. My thought was to hold the chain mail with these posts, but the posts started breaking off. So I was making more problems than I was solving in the early days. But pretty quickly, I figured out that I was going to need multiple components. I needed something on bottom that I would adapt a squishy to. I also needed a top cover, and I needed to be able to assemble those. Now, mechanical engineers know from reading books by Toyota folks that it's better to click things together, then bolt them together. If you can. It makes the manufacturing process fast. So this is the early days of how I started trying to figure that out. I said, well, maybe if I had these two parts and I have a slot and I could put them together like this and I could push them and they just click together, then that would be my assembly process. And so these posts ultimately were foolish. And so I ended up with something that looked like this. So I had a rubber component that I molded with a 3D printed mold that I made. I really enjoyed that process, but ultimately it's too complicated for making the squishy component of this. I did finalize the rigid components. I had the cover, I had the adapter, and they clicked together. After I finished the design, I decided I wanted to be able to take this scrubber head off and hold it with my hand. I measured my fingers and I put these little grooves on there so I could hold it and really get in and scrub really hard. At this point, I got serious about the squishy part. I knew that over molding took too long, so I moved away from that geometry so things could pour through there, and I went to a pad design. So if this was my adapter, I said, what if I had a little pad that goes underneath that was just compliant, and the chain mail itself would keep it in place. So I started designing these little rigid pads, and then my 3D printer, which is a Formlabs Form 3, I had different materials. One was called Elastic. So I started printing Squishy geometries in an attempt to try to figure out what would work best on the grill. So I even tried some linear designs. I tried some hex patterns, and I ended up with something roughly like this. I had all the components, and John took it all to the hardware store and put it together with a wire, and this was our very first prototype. And at this point, we could only get chain mail out of China, so John started testing the different types, and he came up with some very interesting information. When you go against the grain, It'll catch. It puts a lot of tension on the individual rings, and they're coming apart, and we're losing some. But that's a good thing. This is a good thing because we haven't ordered thousands of these pieces of chain mail yet, and we can get a welded version. It's going to cost us a little more money, but we can get a welded version that is going to be stronger, and it's going to make our product better. The supply chain for chain is a big deal to me right now. So John's test revealed that we could not use the most common thing that's on the market, which is this type of chain mail with a radial pattern with a central ring in the middle. We found that that doesn't adapt well to the grate. So we want this rectangular pattern, and And John did a lot of testing, and he arrived at not a square like this, but if we got an octagonal pattern of the rectangular grid, this will do what we need. It's really fun to play with, by the way. So this is what we need, and we could only find it in China. That goes against the thesis statement for what we're trying to do. So we worked and worked, and we eventually found a supplier in the US that can make it. However, they can't make the quantities that we need for a price that makes sense. So what we did is we created a contract where we could buy all that we could afford at the rate they have. And we're getting about 2,000 units a month of this stuff right here. And it's incredibly expensive. It is so expensive. That is by far the most expensive part of the whole thing. But we realized these quantities that we're able to get aren't enough. And so we have supplemented that with an Indian supplier. We said, hey, we don't want to do this in China, but we contacted our Indian supplier. We said, we need a stash of chain mail that is the quantities we need in the event that we sell any kind of numbers of the scrubbers. So we ended up buying some Indian chain mail that would augment the quantities that we could get from the American supplier because that's all they could produce. And that's where we're at. So, yeah, that's where we're at on chain mail. One inch long stainless steel, 1/4-20 bolt. This was so difficult. I know it sounds like an industrial commodity, seems like a simple thing. But if you want to buy this made in the USA, and you stipulate that, that changes everything. Foreign bolt like this, nine cents a piece. In the US, average, 38 cents a piece. Here's a quote right here. If I buy 10,000 of these, 42 cents a piece, that's pretty standard. Most machine shops I talk to directly, they said, Yeah, we can't even get the material for the price of the finished bolts that you're getting from a foreign supplier. Finding people to get quotes for you, very difficult. I emailed a lot of people. I sent out this tweet. It helped, and it's a very fascinating thing. Eventually, after literally months of emailing people back and forth, John picked a supplier that got him for 35. 5 cents a piece, which we then verified were made in Massachusetts. So instead of a dime to get our bolts from a foreign supplier, we're doing roughly this because we think it's important to have manufacturing capacity for stainless steel bolts in Massachusetts, which is weird because my uncle used to work down the road at a bolt factory that closed. But now I'm going to Massachusetts to get this bolt, which is interesting, right? Very interesting. After we bought our bolts, quote came in for 19 cents a piece. Other salesmen told me, There's no way that's American. I couldn't verify. It got sketchy. I don't know. I have no idea what to do with that. I thought it would be simpler. They're on the shelf, they're made in the USA. Buy them, they're this price. Very difficult. The next part of this story is very interesting. I had my parts and it was time to injection mold, and I went to a facility that does injection molding, and I said, Can you make these parts? And they said, Yes, we can make the parts. And I said, That's great. I would also like to make the molds here because I want to learn more about molds. And they said, Oh, no, we don't make molds here. And I said, Why not? They said, We don't do that. We ship the part, the CAD file to China, and they make the mold, and they send it back, and then we injection mold. I said, no, that's not what I want to do. I don't want intellectual property in China, I want to make it here. And they said, Good luck. And this is the moment where this whole experiment came into focus for me. I realized at that moment we're screwed. I think we're screwed as a nation if we can't do the intelligent work of tool and die, making the tools that make the things. It used to be that America did the smart thing, and then we would send the machine that we made to another country, and the country would operate the machine in the developing world. We have flipped it. We are now to the point where the smart stuff is done somewhere else, and they send us the machines, and we push the buttons to operate the machines. I need you to understand this because I realize we have lost something very, very important, and we did it by lulling ourselves to sleep, by pushing money around and doing the intellectual property work, but not doing the manufacturing work. I think it was best put simply by the CEO of Apple, Tim Cook, while sitting in China when he was asked a question about tooling. There's a confusion about China. Let me at least give you my opinion. The popular conception is that companies come to China because of low labor cost. I'm not sure what part of China they go to, but the truth is China stopped being the low labor cost country many years ago. That is not the reason to come to China from a supply point of view. The reason is because of the skill and the type of skill it is. The products we do require really advanced tooling, and the precision that you have to have in tooling and working with the materials that we do are state of the art. The tooling skill is very deep here. In the US, you could have a meeting of tooling engineers, and I'm not sure we could fill the room. In China, you could fill multiple football fields. So Tim Cook said that in 2017 at the Fortune Global Forum. Now, there's two ways of looking at this. One way is, well, Tim Cook is, of course, going to say that. He's incentivized because his business is tied up in China. He's not going to cross the Communist Party because he needs his stuff to be made there. The other way to look at it is, well, Well, maybe that's right. Maybe the tooling and advancement is somewhere way beyond what Americans can do. So here's what I want to do. I know a man that is specifically unique in the world that can answer this question. He's a friend of mine named Jeremy Fielding. He has a YouTube channel. He's an engineer. He speaks Chinese. He spent a significant amount of time exploring these topics in China, and he's right there beside you. Let's just ask him. All right, Jeremy. What do you think about what Tim Cook said about labor and about the tooling industry in China? [J] Well, it'd be hard for me to comment on tooling specifically, but I do think that we do have a common misconception, including myself before I went, that in China, that their product is inferior. I mean, the quality of manufacturing is surprisingly good. When I started comparing that mentally to all the places I've visited, because I've been to many shops here and over there, if it wasn't for the fact that they were speaking a different language, I would feel like I was in the same place. I was really impressed. I think I would say it's at least equivalent to what we can make here. In some cases, things that used to be available in America aren't available anymore. It's like you have to go to China to get it because we just don't do it here some more. [D] Oh, that's scary. Okay, this is a tangent we could talk about for hours just on this topic. I just want to encourage you to go watch Jeremy's channel because it's awesome. You do engineering videos, and there's also content there about your time in China, right? [J] Yeah, absolutely. [D] How do I say thank you in Chinese? How do I say thank you? [J] Xiè xie [D] Xiè xie So that gives you a peek into the world of Chinese manufacturing, but on the American side, it's very different. We talked about this when I was a guest on a podcast called Search Engine. Shruthi and PJ invited me on to talk about what it was like to try to find a mold maker to make this thing. This was a light bulb moment for me in the conversation. The problem is not just that we've forgotten a lot about how to make things in America, it's that we're also forgetting how to make the things that make the things. We go deep into the topic of the tool and die trades in America. It's fascinating. Check that out. I called Chris Robeson, the guy that made the mold during the pandemic, and I asked for help. And not only did he agree to help me, he decided to mentor me. The first thing I did is send him my CAD files of the drawings, and he told me everything that was wrong about them. I had to redesign things because there were things I didn't understand about injection molding. For example, you don't want some areas to be too thick, you want draft angles, all these things. Chris walked me through the process and taught me the proper way to design an object for injection molding. There were three parts to my prototype, so Chris designed three molds, and we wanted to try a new technique. So this isn't a thing that you can do for thousands of parts, but for a few dozen parts, you can 3D print the mold cavities with Formlabs' Rigid 10K solution. So that's what we did. And these are those parts right here. These are 3D printed inserts that we could run in Chris's injection molding machines to verify that the geometry is correct. It actually worked. We got a few dozen working parts, and this let us see how the plastic would flow in the mold, and we made mold design changes. So it's Chris's vast knowledge of tool making and injection molding that allowed us to create molds that would work. It's now time to make the production tool out of metal. You can send this off and get it done in a machine shop. They're not going to have the knowledge of the tool and die making, but they can just make a metal part if you send them a CAD file. I wanted to learn how to CNC machine. I've always wanted to learn how to do that. So me and the younger engineer named Trent, we started learning how to machine. I was able to pick up two used CNC machines. Thank you again, patrons. It started out pretty rough. Wow. But then we figured it out. This process was incredibly enjoyable. I thought it would be intimidating, but I called friends like Shane from Stuff Made Here and local machinists and Chris himself. They taught me what speeds and feeds I needed to use, and this process was awesome. One night, I was machining in the garage, and my friend Daylan came over to hang out, and we started talking about the importance of making things in America and how it affects local communities. [Daylan] All the opportunities to have education and so on went away. What's happening? [D] I'm filming you. Talk about manufacturing in America. [Daylan] When those jobs went away in those communities, all those economic prospects and ultimately educational prospects and quality of life prospects went away. So manufacturing, coming back to America is really important to me because of what it's meant historically for communities in terms of opportunities for kids. So figuring out a way to do that is something I spend a lot of time thinking about. [D] We took all the metal parts to Chris and the guy that works with him named Jeremy, and they assemble the molds, and they explain that there's a couple of things that weren't quite right. They then took the time to fix it, and then they put them all together. And this is what was interesting to me. I realized that a machinist is not enough to be an injection mold designer and maker. They're two different things. You have one set of skills that feeds into the other, but ultimately that tool and dye creation is its own thing. But here we are. We have these beautiful molds, and we're ready to make parts. It felt so good to watch parts pop out of these injection molding machines, knowing how much work went into the molds, it was awesome. Out of the three injection molded parts, it was the Squishy part that I was most concerned about. Now, this is made out of a thermoplastic polyurethane called Santoprene, and it's only heat resistant up to a few hundred degrees Fahrenheit. John did a test. Yeah, it definitely got some melt in there. So obviously, we were going to have to change that material, and silicone is the best option. Now, the problem is we can't inject silicone with the same molds that we made. It's a whole different process. Unfortunately, I couldn't find anybody in my area. They just weren't here. So I had to reach out to a guy in Virginia called Commonwealth Manufacturing. Kevin hooked us up. He made a nine cavity mold so the silicone process could work. So by switching from the santoprene to the food-grade silicone, we bought ourselves another couple of hundred degrees Fahrenheit. However, it's not meant to be used on a fiery furnace, blazing hot grill. It's meant to be used on a cold to warm grill. The handle has its own story, and there was a ton that went into this. The first thing I did is I found a metal tool that I liked, and I just went over to an Anvil and I just beat a little flat edge on the end of the thing, and then I cut out the end on a band saw and drilled a hole in it, and we put that on the prototype and gave it to John's mom to test. This is great. Since it passed that test, it was time to design it for manufacturability. So I went back to CAD and realized if I was going to be bending up sheet metal, I might as well put a flat scraper on the front so that you could get into the corners and stuff like that. I put a little bitty curve on the edge of the scraper so that you could get around the grill grates, and that was our design. I made I'm making a video on Smarter Every Day about sheet metal stamping, and the reason is because I was doing research into how to manufacture this handle. Sheet metal stamping is a process that involves using tooling to cut and bend metal into the shape you want. When we made that video at TNC Stamping, I spoke to a tool and die expert named Roger, who taught me some critical concepts about tool and die. It was pretty clear to me that Roger had forgotten more about tool and die than most people will ever know. In the time between filming that video about metal stamping and filming this video, Roger passed on. He's no longer with us, and that's a big deal. Obviously, his family and friends and coworkers are going to miss him. Roger seemed like a great guy. Probably takes years just to learn the vocabulary of the trade, right? You hear that? It takes years to learn to speak like I speak. But there's another loss here for the community that's not as obvious, but it's very important. And that's all of the experience and tool and die wisdom that Roger has acquired over the years, he can no no longer pass that along. We only have what he gave us while he was here. Furthermore, all the experience of the person that taught Roger, all that has stopped now. All we have is what he passed on before he left. So that makes what you were about to see very, very important. You're about to witness the birth of a tool and die worker in America. When I first visited TNC Stamping, Weston explained that they had a tool and die shop, and they invest heavily in their tool and die apprenticeship program, which is becoming increasingly rare among American manufacturers. They showed us the progressive stamping dies that they made, but John and I couldn't afford one of those, so Weston agreed to give us a price to make what's called station tooling. A tooling engineer named Joey worked with a young man named Logan. Logan used to be a press operator, but he's entered into the apprenticeship program for Tool & Die. The tool that made our handle is the first tool that Logan ever made. [D] Is this the first one you've made? [L] Yes, sir. [D] And how long did it take you? [L] About six weeks. [D] So are you been training him? I've helped. [L] He's a lot of help. [D] So do you feel like you know how to do the next one now? [L] As long as I got prints to go by, I could build it, yes, sir. [D] Really? Did you ever think you would have this skill? [L] I never knew anything like this really existed. During high school, with everything, I didn't know what I was going to do. I started out up here as just a press operator, actually running these presses and got the opportunity to move over as an apprentice, and I've enjoyed it ever since. All the hands-on stuff, learning stuff every day. I",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ve really enjoyed it ever since I've been over to it. [D] It is really fun to watch the tool Logan made an action. Flat blanks that have been cut out with a laser are loaded onto the tool, where as the press comes down, it gets bent into a specific shape along the way. It's called station tooling because the part is then moved from one station to the other, and progressively, the different bends and shapes are put into the part. I think the side action that bends the handle around into a tube is my favorite. After that, we put them in a box and we take them back to Chris's place, where he lasers a logo on the handle, which is really cool. This is currently the bottleneck in the process. It's a little slow. We're trying to automate this, but my favorite part, we get to put Made in the USA on the handle. How cool. All of these parts down here go together to make the scrubber head, and the scrubber head is put together with a piece of stainless steel wire, which we have confirmed is made in Pennsylvania. Now, the rope, however, is harder to confirm the manufacturer's location. We haven't been able to verify it's made in the USA, which brings us to the knob. This is an off-the-shelf item that we ordered, and when we ordered it, we were told it was made in America. We have a problem, right? That's right. We thought they were made in America, but when they got here, they're not. They're made in Costa Rica. So we've got to fix that. So that's what we get. So the first 20,000 lucky customers are going to have their scrubbers with Costa Rican knobs. Yeah. It's probably going to be more than that because it's going to take me a while to figure out how to make a mold for this. Chris and I are already working on this mold, but we want to reach out to this new company that's got this new technology we think could be disruptive to the mold making industry. Nice to meet you, Ted. How are you doing, man? [T] Good. How are you doing? [D] So you own Mantle. [T] That's correct. [D] So I found your company because the injection molder that I know Chris Robeson, he's been wanting to work with your machines for years. My understanding is that you are a 3D printing company that can print metal. Is that right? [T] That's correct. That's all we do. We invented a new process to print metal, and we specifically use it to make injection molds and other type of hard tooling like that. [D] What I've seen with some of the powder bed fusion laser sintering type methods is that it's very difficult to get a good surface finish. How are you doing metal with a surface finish that's acceptable for injection molding? [T] Most of the other processes that do metal printing melt metal powders with a laser, and they end up with a surface finish that's like 80 grit sandpaper, and it's just not near smooth enough for injection mold tools. Our Our process is actually a hybrid process, which means it uses additive plus subtractive. So we actually put down this metal paste, we dry it so it firms up. But then after a few layers of that, we come in and actually cut it with a CNC. So we get a CNC-like finish out of this material. And then as a secondary step, we put them in a furnace and densify the metal into a solid metal part. But we can do things that you could never do traditionally. This medical tool right here looks pretty simple, but these deep grooves you see here have to be done with electric discharge machining. You can't CNC cut those because no one makes an end mill that's skinny enough and long enough that won't break when cutting steel. Our technology allows us to shape, refine, or cut that material as we build up the part. And so we get a part that can get any of those really unique geometries you need for tools. [D] So your technology is aimed at improving the tool and die industry. What are your thoughts on tool and die makers in general in the US? [T] I think we need more of them. I think the incentives to go into tool and die have gone downhill. So I saw a New York Times article that showed a graph that in the '80s, '90s, tool and die makers were above the average by about 20 % in terms of income in the United States. That's dropped today to 15 % below the standard income level. And so it's tough to justify going into tool and die. [D] I think that's changing. I've noticed that people really like making things in America. I'm excited about it, and other people I talk to are excited about it. And your technologies like yours are very interesting. I think it's coming back. [T] There's no question that there's a huge demand for this, right? So I talk to companies every day. They're like, I've got tool and die makers, but they're about to retire. They have open jobs today. There are tons of positions available. So I think that it's looking up for tool and die, especially when you combine it with new technology. [D] I think the time to get into a thing is not when everybody else is doing it. It's before the wave happens. So if I was a young person, I would be looking into this right now. [T] Let's just say that AI is taking software coding jobs left and right, but it's not taking tool and die jobs. [D] Interesting. Yeah. Mechanical, physical things are where it's at, isn't it? [T] We're not there yet. Optimist robot can barely serve a drink at a party for Elon Musk. It's not going to make a tool and die anytime soon. [D] It's a great point, Ted. I hadn't thought about that? The reason I wanted to reach out to you is I'm trying to make this product in America, and we're doing everything we can to make everything in America. And my understanding is we were told that this right here was made in America, but when we got it, the box said made in Costa Rica, and so obviously, I have to make it in America. And so I've learned the hard way. I'm not saying the hard way, but I've learned the right way or the traditional way to make a mold insert. And I was wondering if you'd be willing to work with me to make another mold using your technology for this knob. [T] That'd be great. We print stuff like that all the time. We can do all types of geometries. That would be a shoe in for our technology, and we could do it a lot faster than you would normally as well. [D] Will you please help me? [T] I will do my best. I'll do my best. Anything to keep grill brush bristles from ending up in people's throats is definitely something I'm on board with. [D] That's right. I saw your email on your reply to this. So maybe we could talk about that in the pitch in the last part of this video. [T] For sure. I've experienced the problem firsthand. It's funny you said in your email like, People know someone that knows someone that's had this problem. Like, no, that's me. I've had this problem. I'm the guy. [D] That's great. We'll talk about that later. So that's the story of how we made the Smarter Scrubber. But there's one more thing you need to know about. You remember I told you that we had this American chain mail and we wanted to get some more chain mail, and we had to go to India to get the quantities we need in the event that we sell out of everything we have from the American chain mail. Well, I'm in the middle of making this video, and a couple of days ago, I thought it would be good to go show you a palette of the American chain mail and a palette of the Indian chain mail to show you that they're two separate things. While I was filming that, something crazy happened, and the camera happened to be rolling. Okay, so this is chain mail that we haven't used in any assembly yet. This is from India. Dude, look at that. That's not from India. That's Chinese. Is that- Is that Chinese? I didn't even notice that. That's your seller's name. He's Indian. I bet they're just shipping it from China to India. I bet that's what they're doing. Is that Chinese? It looks like Chinese. Get Google Translate out. We got this drop ship from India, but I think he just boomeranged it. I do, too. I think a person in India told us it was from India, but it was actually from China, is what I'm thinking. It's got Chinese writing on it. Pu Qi Han Haipai. Man, that looks Chinese. What is that? Says, Haipai refers to East meets West culture from Shanghai in the 20th and 21st centuries. It's part of the culture of Shanghai. That's what it is. Haipai. I don't know what that means. I don't know if that means, but it's definitely not English. Okay. This is so hard. This is so hard. It's the supply chain. Jack. It always goes back to China. Yeah. Everybody wants to make a dime, so it's worth it. I'm shocked. It's pretty weird to set out to try to make a thing completely in America and to find out towards the end of the process that you made something in China anyways. That's really hard to swallow. So this is a big, big problem. And I have like 100 things I want to say because I've learned so much in this process and I did a lot of things wrong. Obviously, we did a lot of things wrong. But I'll limit myself to saying this one thing. If you are ever, ever in a position to make a decision about where your thing is manufactured. Take a second and consider making a little less profit maybe in order to invest in your local community. Because these are people you know and love, and they need jobs, and they need to be able to feed their families. And you need a person in your hometown that can injection mold. You need to be able to do that locally. So that's what I would say. I feel a lot of things right now. I'm not going to say all of them. It's time for the pitch. And before I give you the pitch, I want to say this. I don't think it's right that I had to have a YouTube channel in order to take this risk. I hope that we will invest in manufacturing in America and other places in the West so that it will make sense for people who have a really good idea that will help people. It'll make sense for them to make these types of things in their hometown and take them to market. I don't like the fact that having a YouTube channel was a big part of the calculus in order for me to do this. So I just wanted to say that. So here we go. I'm going to give you a pitch on the Smarter Scrubber, and we will see if you want to buy one. All right. My name's Destin, and I would like to tell you about a product called the Smarter Scrubber. I genuinely believe this is the smartest way to clean your grill. If you go to a store right now and you look at the shelves, you're going to see a ton of options for steel, bristle, wire grill scrubbers. And they're interesting. I mean, there's a lot of different designs. You can tell that this is a very difficult problem because of all the different solutions people are throwing out there for trying to solve it. And these wire bristles are a problem. I don't know if you know this, but those bristles can come off on your grill, and then when you're drilling, they can get in your food and you can ingest that. And that's very, very bad. If you have ever talked to somebody that this has happened to, it's a big deal. And chances are you know somebody that knows somebody that this has happened to because this happens way more than you think. So this is Ted. Ted, my understanding is you had something happen to you with a grill brush. What happened? I was out barbecuing, and I went to eat my salmon that night, and a bristle brush that had gotten on my grill got into my salmon and impaled it myself at the back of my throat. And with some skilled work by my wife and a pair of forceps, I was able to get it out, or she was able to get out of my throat. When it stuck in you, where was it? What did it feel like? All the way at the back, I could barely see it, halfway impaled. And I thought it was a fishbone, but it pretty clearly wasn't once we started to look at it. And it was painful. It's hard to talk. I was lucky that we were able to get it out without having to go to the emergency room. My brother is an ear, nose, and throat doctor, and he says every summer, he's got someone coming in with this problem, and it can be easy in the case of what mine was. It's like, Oh, just see if you can pull it out. I went, Okay. Or it can go all the way down your throat, and now you're talking about a semi-surgical procedure to get that thing So it's not safe, and it's only a matter of time if you keep using those bristle brushes. Ted's situation ended up okay, but there is a worse situation that can happen. John and I have a mutual friend that's a doctor, and when we gave him a smarter scrubber, he told us a story about his partner. He had to do an exploratory surgery to find a grill brush bristle in the bowel of one of his patients. Apparently, this is way more common than I realized. Tyler goes on to explain that he hasn't owned a grill brush with bristles since residency. I've debated on whether or not to show you pictures of that, and I've decided to do it this way. I'm going to show you a picture for one second on the screen, and you have the option of closing your eyes. But this is from a medical paper of a person that had to go under exploratory surgery, and they found the bristle sticking out of the gut inside the body. So I'm going to show you that picture. Close your eyes if you want to. In three, two, one. There it is. Yeah, that's bad. It's bad. You don't want to do that. That was the thrust behind wanting to build the Smarter Scrubber. But the more I get to thinking about why this needs to exist, the more I realize there are other reasons why we should make a product like this. This is made in America. All of the components are not currently made in America, but we're moving that way. We're trying very hard to do that. I have noticed that a lot of products on the market right now are cheap. They're made poorly. I understand why you would be tempted to buy the cheaper product because it feels like you're spending less money, right? Let's look at a graph and let me show you why even if the Smarter Scrubber is four times the cost of this, it's in your best interest. Check this out. If we look at this graph, when you first purchase, it feels like this. It feels like the cheap one cost about one-fourth as much, and you've spent that much money. It feels like you've wasted money, right? This literally says on a sticker to buy a new one every year. If we play this out over time, look at what happens. You are buying a new one of the cheap ones every year instead of just buying one good one that lasts. So you are saving money by buying the more expensive scrubber over time. It's very important. This has actually got a name. This is called the Boots Theory of socioeconomic unfairness. The theory is if you buy a cheaper product, you're going to spend more money over time because you have to keep replacing it. So it makes more sense to get a higher quality item. So one of the things we wanted to do with the Smarter Scrubber is we wanted to make something that was strong that you would have for a long time. One thing I don't apologize for, I've actually heard this feedback, I do not apologize for this feeling like a medieval weapon. We actually talked to a person that handles grill products for a big company. You would recognize the name if I told you. And we put it in his hand. The first thing he said was, well, this feels like an American made product. And I was like, What does that mean? And he said, It's very strong. And I don't apologize for that. That's what I was going for. Another thing I want to tell you about is the fact that I designed it so that you can pull the head off the top and you can clean things by hand. So even if you don't use it on your grill, you can use just the head at your sink and you can clean your cast iron pots and pans with that. It works really, really well. Another thing is you can take this and just throw it in the dishwasher. We've made it out of materials that can handle the dishwasher no problem, so you can clean this thing and get the gunk off of it really easily. The Smarter Scrubber is a problem that I wanted to solve. I've been wanting to design something and build it in America for a for a really, really long time, and this is my first go at it. And I would encourage you to try it because I genuinely think you will love it. You can go check out the reviews on the website. We're selling this at SmarterScrubber.com I think it's a great thing. You're going to pay a little more for it, and that's because we made it well. We didn't make it to just throw away. If you go into the store and you buy any one of these, I want you to think about the person that made it for you. They don't care about you like I care about you. When they put a sticker on here, it says something like, Stop using if bristles are found on the grill, replace after one year of use is recommended. That person is just trying to sell you a grill scrubber. I'm not. I'm trying to make your life better, and I'm trying to make it in America because I want people here locally to have jobs. I care about you. I care about your health. And I want you to try out the smarter scrubber to see if this is something that would work for you and your family. Ultimately, it's about playing the long game. You can buy nice or you can buy twice. I think if you buy this, it'll last for a really, really long time. If you buy those other things, I'm worried that you might get hurt. I would really like for you to try the Smarter Scrubber at SmarterScrubber.com. If you don't buy the smarter scrubber, do me a favor. Don't use any of these wire bristle grill brushes anymore. I don't think it's safe for you or your family. All right, how did the pitch go? I hope it worked. We'll see. I guess we'll find out. So I hope after this whole thing was done, that you recognize what I was going for. I was trying to get the right mixture of intellectual humility because I had no idea what I was doing, but also just sheer determination to make it happen. So that's the balance I was trying to strike. And I would love to know your comments on the experiment as a whole. It took a lot of time, but clearly I did some stuff wrong. I could have done better. I'd love some feedback. With that, I got some things that I want to say that's important to tell you. So enjoy the footage while I say this stuff. First of all, John has been working with the team to stockpile these scrubbers. We've got thousands of them stockpiled and ready to go, but we don't know how many orders we're going to get as a result of the video. So if you go to the website and it says pre-order, that means the grill scrubber you're buying hasn't been made yet. So you can go ahead and purchase it, and we'll get it to you as soon as it's built. We're hoping to get a surge of orders from this video, so if that happens, please be patient with us. John's a little scared, which is fun. Our plan is to use the profits we get from these initial sales and put it right back into the process and tooling. For example, right now, our bottleneck is the laser marking process. We're going to try to build a conveyor belt system to do that automatically. That's going to be a tremendous investment. But one of the lessons I learned from this experiment, as well as the manufacturing series, is that it's smart to invest in your process and tooling. Which leads me to the fact that a couple of these components may or may not be made in a different country, depending on when you buy it. I'm working on making everything 100% in America. However, if you buy it and it has something from somewhere else, we're going to make sure that the quality is top-notch. So we're working on that. Thank you for your patience. A huge thank you to patrons and people who tested early prototypes. We listened to everything you said and we made changes, and that made the product better. Thank you. Currently, we can ship to the US and Canada. We figured all that out. We have some partners in Europe. We're trying to get there, and we'll expand to worldwide as we can. When you get this thing, if for any reason you're not happy, reach out to us and we'll make it right. That being said, don't put this on a crazy hot surface. You can melt it if you're not thoughtful, so be smart about it. Last thing, if you are interested in being a wholesaler for the Smarter Scrubber, as we get more efficient and we're able to bring the cost down, maybe we get more tooling that's more efficient, then we would love to have the Smarter Scrubber in your store. So if you're interested in selling this thing, I've got a link down in the video description. If you'll reach out, we'll be in touch, and maybe we can work something out as we get more efficient at building this thing. All right," that's it. I hope you enjoyed this. Thank you so much for watching this video. I'm grateful. I'm Destin. You're getting Smarter Every Day. Have a good one. Bye.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8nilP--GFLY,The Unsolved Mystery of Impact Flashes - Smarter Every Day 307,,Educational,"I'm very excited about this video because it's something I've been wanting to learn for years. Have you ever noticed when you have two things flying very, very fast and they impact in slow motion, that little spot right there where they touch for the first time, there's often a little flash of light, and it looks different at different times, but it's there, and we don't really know what it is. So today's video is all about that. We're going to do experiments here in the garage. We're going to see things that we've done in the past. For example, years ago, some friends of mine and I, we built a supersonic baseball cannon, and we saw it then. No, no, no, no, no, am I seeing fire? There's fire!?! There's fire!! That was unexpected That is seriously like striking a match. That doesn't compute. I kept the glove. What causes that? We have a leather glove and a leather baseball. Why is there a flame? Fire? What is that? Because this also happens when the baseball hits a plastic bucket of sprinkles. Two, one. So we've got another flash of fire/light, whatever it is. Just a couple of frames in the ultra high-speed video. But then we also see something like it when we fire a bullet versus a Prince Rupert's drop. So that's metal versus glass. Okay, look at this. Bullet versus bullet. Both of these are lead. [Explosion followed by glass shattering sounds] There's another time I've seen flashes when I hit things. In this garage, with that high-speed camera right over there, I'm going to show you in a minute, when you hit Wintergreen lifesavers with a hammer, you get sparks, and it's crazy. And then perhaps the most fun is when we shot a gallon of mayonnaise. That is amazing. So we made fire. We dieseled mayonnaise. Ken is on fire. This is the best advertisement for Ken's extra mayonnaise ever. Dude. And it's not just my stuff. Have you ever heard of How Ridiculous on YouTube? [Brett] We have 15 giant balloons all in a massive line. Oh, my goodness. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. This is Brett with How Ridiculous. You guys do all kinds of crazy stuff, right? [B] Our channel is called How Ridiculous, and I think that accurately describes what we've done for many years. [D] I love it, dude. What were you doing when this thing happened? This light? [B] We had two glass spheres, probably, I don't know a bit smaller than a bowling ball, I would say. We don't know the exact speeds, but they were probably going at least 100 miles an hour. [D] And what happened? [B] Well, miraculously, we got them to collide at all. So the balls didn't fit perfectly in the canon. So we had basketballs put in first, then the glass balls. So then when we fired the glass balls out, in the slowmo, it was super strange. One glass ball comes out of the left side, and then the other side, a basketball comes out first, and one of the guys were with us like, did we forget to put the glass ball in the other canon? We're like, no. So what happened is the basketball must have been not that inflated or whatever. And the one on the right side has actually come out in front of the glass ball somehow. And then it's getting closer and closer to the barrel. And we're like, come on, we really need this to happen. And then the glass ball just emerges and we celebrate because we know, Oh, we're going to see a collision, which was one thing we didn't know if it even happened. And then as they collide, there's this flash of light and you see from the footage, we just were completely shocked, surprised. We celebrated. We just knew we'd captured something really, really epic and rare. [D] So you saw a flash of light when they hit? [B] Yeah, that's right. [D] Another channel you probably heard of, The Slo-Mo Guys, Gavin and Dan, fantastic guys, really good friends of mine. In fact, In fact, the reason there's paint on my ceiling right there is because they did that. We've worked together for many years. They have a ton of footage. I wanted to talk to Gavin about this. How are you, man? Good to see you. [G] Good to see you. [D] So you guys were trying to shoot a bullet through a bullet. [G] This one was as simple as I wanted to try and recreate the shot where one character gets shot through his own bullet, basically, by a different bullet. [D] What happened when they hit? [G] There was just a big flash on impact as one bullet went into the the hollowed out area of the bigger bullet, and everything mulches together. It's so hard to film. Even at hundreds of thousands of frames a second, you see it for a few frames. [D] So we have flashes of light with leather versus leather, leather versus plastic, hammer made out of steel versus sugar. We've got metal versus metal, and we have glasses versus glass. We've got all these different things happening, and there are a few different explanations that could possibly describe these things. I think it's pretty obvious that one of these things is not like the others. When we hit the lifesavers with a hammer and we get this blue light that's happening, it seems to be coming from the fracture itself, not from the impact. In fact, later in this video on the second channel, we shot the lifesavers with a pellet, and we saw the blue flashes of light, but something interesting happened. We saw the flash of light on the impact surface, but we also saw it on the side opposite of the impact surface where the lifesaver was ripping apart. That tells me that this is happening because of the fracture or the cleaving of those crystalline structures. And in the video, we refer to this as triboluminescence, which has to do with the fracture of a crystalline structure. That's fascinating, and that differentiates it from these other impact flashes we're seeing. So what do you think it was? [B] Well, I think initially we had no idea. We were like, what is that? One of the guys that was with was a high school science teacher. And so he ended up having a bit of a look into it, and he thought it was this phenomenon called triboluminescence, which mysteriously, he's like, it's not fully understood, but what we've demonstrated is maybe one of the bigger versions of it that anyone's seen. Often that's really small things, but we've done it on such a big item that it was such a rare occurrence that he was like, I think we've seen something that's truly special today. [D] So when I first saw the two glass balls hit each other on Brett and How Ridiculous video, I thought, yeah, that looks like triboluminescence. But the more I started reading, the more I realized that triboluminescence, apparently, is something that happens on solids with crystalline structures. Glass is an amorphous solid. It's not a crystalline structure solid, to my understanding. I really appreciate the humility here. Brett's like, I think this is what it is because that's where I'm at. I thought that's what it was as but I don't know. There's these other things. There's another mechanism called fractoluminescence. When things fracture, they cause light. There's other things called mechanoluminescence, I think is what it's called. There's all these different possibilities that we have here. Another one is just straight up friction. We've got a baseball coming into a glove really, really hard. Is it creating enough friction that it causes light of some sort? There's a lot of really big words to describe when light is produced. It's almost like the term luminescence is used as a suffix for when we get light from something we don't understand. Sonaluminescence, fractoluminescence, triboluminescence, mechanicaluminescence. All these things seem to be rolled into the thing I did made light, and I don't know how. I've even thought about electrostatic discharge. When two things come close and they have dissimilar charges, they'll zap a little bolt of lightning across the gap there. There's a lot that this could be. I've even thought about the Kopp–Etchells effec. That's when you have helicopter blades rotating in a sandy environment, and when the sand hits the helicopter rotors, you get little flashes of light. There's a lot of things this could be, and I want to show you something that happened right here in this garage that makes me think I'm starting to understand this. Okay, so let me show you a paper over here. This is a paper written by a guy named GI Taylor, Sir Taylor, the same Taylor that did the ultra-laminar flow. Okay, this is a paper by GI Taylor, and what he did way back in 1947 is he developed a way using math to describe the strength of materials upon impact. So basically what he was trying to do is he was trying to create a relationship between dynamic stress, yield stress and the velocity of a cylinder hitting a flat plate. This is called a Taylor impact test. So if you're a mechanical engineer and you're going to model something using finite element analysis, one of the first things you do is a Taylor impact test. Which is why we have this crazy device sitting right here in my garage. Okay, so this is a twelve gage shotgun, and it's bolted to the steel table here. And I've got this crazy box that I designed and had a friend help me make. So what happens is you shoot some cylinders into this thing and you strip off what's called a sabot. Now, this is what the projectile looks like. A sabot, what it means is you have a thing on the outside of the projectile that takes up the diameter between your projectile, which is that rod in the middle, and the side of the barrel of the gun. And you can see I designed this sabot so that the sabots would fall away. They would pedal away like that. And so what happens is this rod will be fired here, and it will go into this chamber, and then as it peddles out, the sabot  will be stripped away by this plate, and then it'll go over to this plate and impact this surface. So the idea is to take a cylinder and impact this plate. This is called a Taylor impact test. Now, the velocity that you use or you generate with the gun, as you hit that at different velocities you should get different amount of yielding, like mushrooming. Taylor came up with the original relationships between yield stress, and he showed that it was different with dynamic stuff. So this was an analytical model, meaning he used math. But then he got some friends. He's got Carrington here. Carrington actually did some of the test, and he mushroomed some projectiles, and they took microscopy of the results. And he had another guy here named Wiffon, and Wiffon did the same thing. And so they were able to come up with a relationship between the strength of material, the velocity of the cylinder, and how much it squished. So let me explain what I was doing when what I'm about to show you happened. So I was doing some initial tailor impact tests, and I had different cylinders cylinders that I had created with different photopolymers. There's a company called Formlabs, and they have these different plastics that you can 3D print. So I made some cylinders, and I was testing the cure time. I would cure it for 15 minutes in the oven. I'd cure it for 30 minutes. I'd cure it for 45 minutes, and I started getting really different results with impacts. But one of the things I wanted to do is I wanted to test polycarbonate, and I wanted to do it really, really fast. So David, who was helping me that day, and we made a hot load on the shotgun shell, so I can change the velocity by how much powder I put in this thing. So we made a really, really fast load, and we shot a rod of polycarbonate against that flat piece of stainless steel, and something amazing happened. Two, one, fire. [Bang] See what happened. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. Oh, man. That's nuts. Dude, look at this. We stripped the Sabot. It just turned bright. Look at that. Flash big time, didn't it? That's crazy. What on Earth? What the heck? What is even happening? And then it splattered like crazy. Okay, so that flash was crazy, right? I mean, it looks like a little bitty bomb going off on one side of the impact surface is there. But one thing that made it so undeniably different from everything else we've seen, glove versus baseball and all this stuff, is that it seemed to have a direction to it. So when it hit, it almost farted out the side of the impact surface, like poof, and it made this little cloud of fire over to one side. You see that? It clearly has a direction, and that direction seems to somehow be related to the obliquity of the cylinder as it impacts the surface. Okay, let me try to explain what I'm talking about here. I've got a little bitty booger of clay here, right? And I've got my rod that I'm going to shoot against the surface. If the rod comes along and it hits this thing perfectly straight, it's going to squash out the gas that's in between the rod and the surface. We're going to get a flat, like a flat, squish, okay? But if I don't hit at an orthogonal direction, I have a little bit of obliquity to it, meaning I'm tilted like this. As it hits, what's going to happen is it's going to roll that gas out to one side, and you're going to get this little poof out in one direction. There's going to be some directionality to it. When I told a friend about this, his name is Louis, I said, Man, look at this. He's like, Oh, man, look, the little gas. I was like, Yeah, I know, right? He sent me this paper, Using mechanoluminescence as a low-cost Non-destructive Diagnostic Method for Transient Polymer Impact Processes. Now, when I looked at this paper, what's interesting is the researchers basically built a little thing. They said, Look, when we hit plastics versus something. We're getting this really big flash. And they actually created a device to measure where that flash starts and where it moves to. And they use that as a way to measure the obliquity of impact. And they have this really super cool graph here that I think is really neat. So basically, you can see the impacts in the middle there, and then it starts pushing out to the side. And they use that as a way to measure impact obliquity, which I think is really cool. So these researchers, Gwo and Chin, in Indiana somewhere, they... Oh, at Purdue. Indiana somewhere, Purdue. Okay, so Chin and Gwo at Purdue, they say it's a meccanoluminescence. They say it's the breaking of polymer bonds that create this light. I don't know that I agree. I think it's the gas. So I showed this video to the smartest person I know, Don Pettit. Don is a genius. He's really good at surface chemistry. And Don said, Oh, this is interesting. Destin, what if you fill the box with a different gas and see if you get a different effect? He says, Argon is known to flash very brightly when it's activated, so maybe you could do that. And so I started looking up some stuff. There's this thing called shock ignition. And so I don't know how that works because noble gasses, we're told, don't burn. They're noble. They don't oxidize. So the idea of burning argon or igniting argon is interesting. It will flash before some of the other gasses will. So that's what we're going to do today. We're going to put argon over in that box, and we're going to see if we can get a different effect. I think that's really cool. So What I've got here is I've got this LC 320s high-speed camera. We're going to get an overall view of what's going on, not a high frame rate. And then we're going to use the V2511 here. A little loud, but we're going to set it up and we're going to try to get a really high frame rate of what's going on. But before I do that, I want to try to recreate the compression of a gas to make fire. I've purchased a couple of little science toys here. This is a thing called a fire syringe. It's literally a syringe, and we're going to compress the gasses. Now, if we look at this paper that I found, using the ideal gas law, if you compress, there's a really cool example here. If If you compress a gas, depending on the value of Gamma, then you can go, let's say we compress it seven times. So we go from one atmosphere to seven atmospheres. The temperature goes really, really high. So just by compressing a gas, and if you do it fast enough, you don't lose temperature to a conduction and stuff, that's called adiabatic compression. That's what a fire syringe does. This is just a piston, and it's got an O-ring at the end, two O-ring, and this is just a cylinder. So the instructions say I'm supposed to put a little cotton fluff in there, and I think the cotton fluff is what's going to catch on fire. Let me shove that down in there. Okay, Good. Okay, so let's just put this. Okay, so the syringe is in there, and this cylinder is charged with just normal room air, and we're going to slap this thing and see if we can make fire. All right, here we Three, two, one. Yeah. Let's go look at that in high speed. We compressed the gas inside this cylinder. And once we did that, because of ideal gas law, the temperature goes really high till it exceeds the, I don't know, the flame temperature of cotton. I guess that's what it is. I think because of Rade Bradbury, I know that paper burns Fahrenheit 451. So I bet cotton somewhere around there. So it got really hot in there. But I don't think that was the actual gas is burning. That was the cotton burning. It looks pretty cool, though. This is what's known as adiabatic compression. Basically, adiabatic is a fancy word that means heat doesn't enter or exit the system. And in this case, the system is the tube. And because it happens so fast, heat doesn't have time to leave the system by being absorbed through the side walls of the fire syringe. So this is adiabatic compression. It looks like it almost squishes everything completely, and then you see a little bitty ignition on the cotton just in one little spot. Okay, let's put more oxygen in that cylinder and see what happens. So I've got two bottles over here. I've got nitrogen and I've got oxygen. Let's put oxygen in that cylinder. Yeah, it's oxygen. We'll see if it burns better. 100% oxygen. Okay, so we should have more oxygen in there now. I think this is going to work brilliantly. Yeah, that worked. Absolutely! Yes, sir! It looks like the spark starts at the moment of most compression, and then it's like that is the spark that starts the flame. And then when we expand the fire piston, so it's burning all over. So we must have got a really, really flammable mixture there. Man, it's even lightened my hand up. That's so beautiful. I love that. My hand looks really weird from this angle. That's odd. Okay, cool. Well, let's move on to else. I still don't know if this is what we're seeing, but that's pretty bright. That's very bright. Let's see if we can do Argon and oxygen and see if Argon makes a brighter flame. Argon, oxygen. Science! [Destin Laughs] Three, two, one. Okay, that felt brighter. That did feel brighter. It also hurt my hand. Oh, dude, it got so bright so fast. My sensor's messed up, but I'm going to call that brighter. Interesting. Looking back on this, I think I wanted it to be brighter. I don't know that it was. Maybe I hit it harder with my hand, but I I don't think this is great data. Let's just move on. Just to double-check because it's a noble gas. Let's do just Argon, and I expect no burning. Just flood the area with Argon. Oh, I did get a smoke, though. It's interesting that it vaporizes when you release. You can see vapor in there, but I don't think... I don't know, maybe it got really hot and some moisture on the cotton itself vaporized or something. I have no idea. I started trying to figure out the way to explain the sponsor for this video, and I drew up a Venn diagram of all the things about the product that I like, but I realized a lot of it has to do with the people. First of all, this is a Canadian company. I like Canadians. In fact, the thumbnail for this video you're watching, probably made by a guy named Jeff from Canada. Really tight with Canadians, but the product that they are doing is cool, and it ticks all the Destin boxes. Number one, machining. I have been learning how to CNC machine for a really, really long time now, and I just get really excited by the smell of cutting fluid. And this product is machined out of aluminum, which is really, really cool. The company name is Henson. They make a razor for shaving, and it's just really cool. You open it up, no plastic. Isn't that interesting? You don't see that very much anymore. Nowadays, when I see a part, I try to figure out how it's made. And I can see under the head here on the razor, you can see the CNC tool path. So I can see that, and I know that part was CNC, shade, but this profile here that holds the razor down in a very precise way, that appears to be ground. I'm not sure about that. It might just be many passes on the CNC at a very fine step over, but it's pretty cool. With all that, you can see why precision is on my Venn diagram. The fact that this curve is held to such a tight tolerance all the way across means it supports the blade. This makes it great for shaving. On my Venn diagram, I've got price. The thing about Henson Razors is the only thing you're replacing are the little bitty blades that go in the razor itself. It's cheap. You can buy a whole razor blade for less than a dime. It's a very smart way to think long term about how you are using a product in your house. The last reason I'm excited to use this product is because of nostalgia. But this is how my grandfather used to shave. He had a razor like this. I'm excited to use something like this for the same reason I like using film cameras and stuff like that. There's something that connects me to the past about using a real safety razor. I grew my beard out so I could shoot this ad, and I did not realize that a normal safety razor like this is better for once your beard is longer like this. I hate that I'm telling you this in an ad because it feels like you're not going to believe it, but it's true. All right, if you want to try a Henson razor, you can do that. Go into hensonshaving.com/smarter. Get a razor like your grandfather used. If you use the promo code smarter at checkout, you get 100 blades, which is basically two years of shaving for free. I like the Venn diagram that makes the Henson Shaving lineup with Smarter Every Day. Hinsonshaving.com/smarter. Give it a shot. Okay, so let's go back and see if we can repeat the thing that happened when David and I were shooting in the garage. So let's get the gun back out and let's see if we can make that flash of light again, just for repeatability purposes. And I got 12 grains of powder in this shotgun shell. I'm going to reconfigure the box So I'm going to make it where I can see through this and see through this front side here. That's dirty, isn't it? And then I've got this shield thing where I can contain it on the back side here. All right. So we've got an armored side, and we have a see through side. So I guess now we can just turn the light on here. Then that's It's not really bright for normal cameras, but we should be able to see it with high speed. We'll give it a shot and see if we can make a flash in there. That's our goal, right? I want to show you how I'm aiming this thing. I 3D printed a little laser adapter here, and I I'm going to get the laser in the barrel. And then over here, if I turn this thing on, I can see the laser on my hand there, right? Which means I got to make sure that the projectile goes through It goes through that and the sabot strip off. So it looks like we're aimed pretty well, but I always like to just look down the barrel because why not? It looks pretty good. It looks like it's pretty aligned. I don't know if you can see that at all, but yeah, it looks pretty good. Drop that plastic in there. Don't want it to be too exciting for us. Okay, so for a real Taylor impact test, what we want to do is we want to measure the length of the projectile. This is polycarbonate 75.25 millimeters. Should be a 50 cal here. You got 12.71 millimeters. How much does she weigh? 11.4 grams. Okay, so we can use that information and we can back out, squish stuff if we had the high speed in the correct position, which we don't. But let's build this projectile here with my 3D printed, sabot. One, two, three. Okay. All right, that works good. All So that is a 12 gauge shotgun shell right there. I'm going to go over here, grab this bad boy like this. All right, we're on there. Okay, ready to go. Camera trigger right here. I'm going to take you off my head for a second. No, just ride this out of my head. Here we go. All right, here we go. Three, two, one. That's exciting. All right, we'll let the smoke settle there. Let's go look at what we got. We did. We got a flash. Right there, the whole thing. And then you can see it dies out right there. That is bizarre. We have to go much faster. It looks like there was a bunch of rust in the barrel. Hadn't shot it in a while. It's absolutely what that was. There's some flashes right there. The sabot hitting the steel. Barely cleared the hole. Shaved a little bit, actually. Still attitude up a little bit. Yeah, same thing. Weird. Oh, we got a flash there when that hit, too. Well, we were able to repeat the flash. That's good. Okay, so we didn't have a high enough frame rate to see exactly what happened. But if you look, if we just go through frame by frame, you can see that it's rolling to one side. It starts when the bottom contacts, but the last bit of light we see is on the top. And that would fit into the little narrative we had earlier with the little booger of clay. Remember when it hits and it rolls to one side? So that could be a thing. I think what we should do now is we should tighten the camera up and go a lot faster. So I'll take this resolution and I'll just make it a lot smaller, and then I'll up the frame rate, and we'll see if we can see something again even faster. Maybe more powder, too, just because. Okay, we're going to do 15 this time. All right. Fifteen grains of powder. It's just a little hot, so I'm going to stay further back. Two, one. That was hot. Goodness, that is so fast. There's a lot of chaos. I love it. It lit up. Oh, man. Yes, a burst. Oh, it maxed it out. Definitely saw the gas. It was so bright, the sensor didn't know what to do with it. Nice. And And we had these little secondary flashes as it goes through. That really feels like gas. And that's the booger theory that I have. You see it's lit up on this corner down here, and then it rolls out And then it shoots, and then it confuses the sensor. Okay, this time I'm going to use an opaque plastic. This is PETG, and we've been shooting polycarbonate, so the question is, will we also get the little flame pooting out the side. This is not the same plastic, so it might shatter and not contain the gas, but I don't know. But this should tell us if we're seeing a triboluminescent thing or if we're compressing a gas in shock, igniting it, maybe. 74.56, 13.5 grams. It's a 16-gram shot. Three, two, one. I think something weird happened. I think the Sabot's came out before the projectile. Sabot's. Very slow rod. So we sheared. So my delivery method did not work. I would be very surprised if we see any fire on this because it's going so slow. We did. It made fire. Even though it was going slow and it did the... That's the booger technique. I'm convinced at this point that a lot of times it's gas. I did see it in that bullet versus bullet video, like you've seen. We did a video a little bit before that. It might have even been the same day, but we've got to record. But we were just shooting straight into steel targets around 800,000 frames a second. That gave a little bit more freedom to see the flash because it wasn't being squished into a tiny little area of a bullet. It was being allowed to spread out more onto this steel plate. What's your theory on what that flash is? My theory based on what I've read, and I feel like, thankfully, I have really smart people in the comments of my videos, a lot of people were saying it was just gasses in the air being compressed to the point where They're physically lighting up, like they're getting that hot briefly. Because I was seeing it get squished between all the gaps where the hollow point little petals meet around the bullet. It was getting fired out of every available space. Now, the question is, what gas? Is it burning? Is something oxidizing? Or I've read about this thing called shock ignition of gasses. I've read about that. I think it's possible that we might be doing that because it's trying to move that gas so fast because it's 90 degrees out of phase from the... Or it's 90 degrees out of line from the flight axis when it hits, it's sending that gas out at an incredibly fast speed. Okay, so it created the little puff of fire with PETG, which is a plastic still. What happens with wood? This is like an insulator. It's not going to be triboluminescence. If we get fire with wood, then that would be amazing. Plus, this is way lighter weight, and we can make it go way faster. This feels like bass wood. This is going to be nothing. 4 grams, so it's like 25% of the mass. I wonder if we even come up to enough chamber pressure just on the shot in terms of ballistics. I'm worried about that. I don't know what's going to happen here. 3, 2, 1. I want to see. [Destin Laughs] Splinters everywhere. Oh, man, that's so good. Look at that. It's just like total carnage. Oh, man, if we see a fireball on this, this is going to be nuts. What are we even doing? This is so fun. Okay, so which one we look at first? Let's look at the big one first. Okay, yeah, we have a lot of unburned powder. A ton of unburned powder because we don't get enough chamber pressure to actually burn all the powder inside the barrel. Man, that is moving. Can wood make fire on steel? It did it. It did it. That's nuts. It's gas. It's got to be gas. Yeah, you can see the flame where it contacts first, and then it rolls it forward and it looks like it got hotter. Not unlike the fire piston, right? But it goes out pretty quickly. It extinguishes it much quicker. We don't see the rolling poof. That makes me wonder if the rolling poof has something to do with the material. I really want to do Argon, and I don't want to asphyxiate myself or suffocate myself. So Argon is heavier than air, I'm told. So what we're going to do is we're going to open the garage here to get some fresh air in, and more importantly, let Argon roll out. I don't think I'm going to use that much Argon. But what I'm going to do is I want to flood this box with Argon now to see if we can get a flash, because I have a Wikipedia article over here. It's on something called Argon Flash. Now, apparently, fancy-pant scientists in real labs, not garages, like my garage, they use... Check this out. Typical Argon flash devices consist of an Argon-filled cardboard or plastic tube with a transparent window on one end and an explosive charge on the other end. Many explosives can be used, PETN, COMP B, RDX. Basically, they put argon in a tube, and then they drive it with an explosive It's really impressive. Somehow, that makes a big flash. Now, what actually happens to make that flash? I don't know. I don't think it's the argon burning, but it's the shock ignition somehow of the argon. It requires a detonation in a supersonic shockwave in the argon. But I don't know if it's the other gasses in the tube that are making the flash or the argon itself that's making the flash. I don't know. But what I do want to know is if we fire polycarbonate, which gave us the most impressive flash, into a box that's flooded with argon, what happens? I think the way I want to do that is I've got this tube right here. This is an argon tank. I want to run a tube into the box like this. Basically, what I want to do is I want to take that hose and I want to pump it in there like that. So we're going to put argon in this side over here. I'm going to get some tape. I'm going to tape the box up so that we don't get leakage around all this, and we can just fill the box up over here with argon and let it flood over into this box. And then right before I fire, I'll pull that hose out and then fire and trigger the high-speed camera all at one time. I'm going to seal up all the Argon leak holes. Very scientific. Okay, let's turn it up. Flooding the box now. Gun is ready. Come on, pull the hose out. Here we go. Hose is out. Ready to trigger. Three, two, one. Our gun is off. Oh, it looks like it didn't make it through cleanly. There was a bright flash for sure. There's other things flashing as they hit, and those are pieces of the Sabo, are they not? It doesn't seem to be any brighter. Interesting. I I think it's sa",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
e to say that we didn't see very big flashes there for whatever reason, maybe because Argon is a noble gas. But what I do know is that I'm starting to feel like the gaseous environment that the impact occurs in dictates how big the flash is, which means we need to fill the box up with oxygen. We're going to make an oxygen-rich environment. Welders everywhere. They're I'm mad right now. All right, there we go. Yeah, there's a lot of oxygen in there, that's for sure. Polycarbonate. Put on the sabot . Three, two, one. That felt bigger. I don't know why. Okay. All right, cut off the oxygen. That did. That felt bigger. Whoa. It's white, and it kept flashing. It also hit more orthogonal than normal. So I wonder if that's another stuff that hit kept flashing. That's pretty big. That's a pretty big flash. I'd say it was bigger. Yeah. I feel like the flashes that we're seeing might not be triboluminescence. Or mechanoluminescence. I think sometimes they are, but I feel like this might be adiabatic compression or something like it. So we're compressing gas. And I think the beautiful thing about that shot is it was done at a 90-degree angle. It was very orthogonal to the impact surface. And I think that makes the gas have to rush out from the front of the impact surface faster because If you think about it, if you have a string and it's got some slack in it and you pull the string really tight, if you do the math, if you pull here, it takes an infinite amount of force on that string to keep it from moving in that direction. I guess what I'm saying is tangent is coming into play. So the velocity of that gas running out from under the impact surface is a function of how orthogonal you hit, which makes me interested in the glass balls hitting, because no matter where the glass balls hit, there's always going to be a 90-degree point because they're two tangents on spheres. There's always going to be one little spot where you're perfectly tangent. This is interesting. We have learned things today, and I want to shoot a marble now. I'm going to shoot a marble. Would you say the light was blue or the light was orange? I thought it was like a white, like whitey blue. When I first saw yours, I thought that it cracked the whole sphere, and then the light from around, like the light from the sun was illuminating the balls. And then I looked again, I was like, I don't think that's what that is. It looks different because it goes away. It does. Yeah, it does go away very soon. Oh, wait. Yeah. I'm about to I'm watching it right here. I'm watching it. No, it is quite yellow. It's yellow. Definitely. And there's nothing yellow around, as in it was snowing actively. Oh, that's a good point. So it was yellow. I'm toying with the idea that this is gas. This is the nitrogen in the air igniting between the balls. And then it's illuminating the glass like a fiber optic. It's like a lens, which is what the balls are. They're a big lens. But see, it It could also be like I'm looking at the Wikipedia page on mechanoluminescence and triboluminescence, and there's a special one called fractoluminescence. So I think it's possible yours is that weird thing, too. So I don't know. Okay, I want to shoot a marble against the plate now, so I have to take the Sabo stripper plate out. So let's do that. So the idea is to fire the marbles directly through here with, I don't know, I guess we'll use some felt or something, and and just impact directly. I've got some marbles shoved in shotgun shells here, and we're going to see if we can make it do it with glass. All right, here we go. Oxygen, and lots of it. All right, so there's oxygen going in the tank. Two marbles. Kind of an attempt at making it work there. Oxygen in the tank. Marbles in the tank. Box full of oxygen. Three, two, one. There's a little flash right there. Oh, man, that's crazy. So gunpowder was still burning right there. Definitely a flash. And then the marble hitting the marble behind it flashed as well. There's so many things I need to do. I need to do a better job of putting the gasses in the box. I need to do some research and figure this out. But anyway, this was a good exploratory thing. So the question is, is it triboluminescence or is it adeabatic compression or is it fractoluminescence? What is going on? I think it has to do with oxygen for sure. The question is, when the plastics hit, are they particulating and then burning instantly? I really think it has a lot to do with the gasses. The question that's remaining for me is, are those gasses burning? I don't know. I'm leaning away from triboluminescence right now, and I'm leaning towards gasses. I need to do it in a vacuum. I need to fire that in a vacuum. That's what I need to do. Okay, anyway. I hope you enjoyed this episode of Smarter Every Day.

JVROsxtjoCw,I Explored the World's First Nuclear Power Plant (and How It Works) - Smarter Every Day 306,,Educational,"[Click] A third of the electricity in my house comes from nuclear power. That's how this sign is lighting up. There's a nuclear power plant down the road. It's making the electricity flow through this gas, and it's lighting things up. You know what else is powering? These lights right here. Today on Smarter Every Day, we're going to start something that I've been wanting to do for oh so very long. I just haven't done it because I've been a little nervous because I want to get it right. We're going to start the Smarter Every Day Deep Dive series into nuclear power. I want to get this deep dive series right because when people hear the term nuclear, it's a loaded term. I mean, most people come to their awareness of the raw physical power of atomic energy through knowledge of atomic weaponry. We've rightfully been taught for years to fear these weapons. What are you supposed to do when you see the flash? Duck and cover. Tony knows the bomb can explode any time of the year, day or night. He's ready for it. Duck and cover. At Boy, Tony, that flash means act fast. [D] In order to do this right, I want to move from knowledge to understanding about how such an incredibly powerful thing can be harnessed safely for the good of humanity. So I think an appropriate place to start is the first place that ever happened. EBR-1, the world's first nuclear power plant. How did it work? We're going to figure that out today, and we're going to gain an understanding of nuclear power. That's what I want to do with this deep dive series. We're going to see people handling nuclear waste. We're going to meet this long-haired guy that's glass-blowing to measure temperatures inside nuclear reactors. We're going to meet people that make this stuff happen, and they're interesting, and they're smart, and they're compelling, and I'm excited. So here we go. This is the first video of many of the nuclear power deep dive series here on Smarter Every Day. So make sure you're subscribed, maybe even sign up for the email list because these videos are incredible. I don't know if you know this, but there are 17 Department of Energy national labs all throughout country here in America. These places do all kinds of incredible research that's going to help us have a new clean power future, and I'm really excited about that. To get started, let's go to a very interesting place. If you want to learn about nuclear reactors, the best place to do it is out here in the middle of Idaho at a place called Idaho National Laboratory. Let's go get smarter every day and learn about nuclear power. [upbeat guitar riff] So about an hour outside of Idaho Falls, Idaho, there's a building that was made in the '50s. This is the home of EBR-1, Experimental Breeder Reactor 1. And I went inside and met Andrew, who's going to show us all about how EBR-1 worked. Okay, here we are at EBR-1, and this is Andrew. [A] Hello, folks. [D] You're going to walk us around, right? [A] Yeah, I suppose so. I'm not sure, did you have any specific questions for me? Do you want to just look around and take a look at everything? [D] Yes, I do. Ebr, what What does the EBR stand for? [A] That's experimental breeder reactor 1. We had breeder piles before this, but they weren't technically reactors. This is the first real breeder reactor. [D] What is a breeder reactor? What does that mean? [A] Ultimately, a breeder reactor is taking uranium-238, bombarding it with fast neutrons to produce plutonium-239. [D] Okay, don't freak out. I know that was a lot of words, but we are totally going to understand what he just said. [A] It's best to start upstairs. [D] Let's do it. I'm following you. This looks awesome, by the way. [A] I mean, this place was built in two years, which is truely incredible. I always joke with people who come through that I'm not sure that we could build a shed in two years nowadays, let alone a whole reactor. [D] By the way, I just went to the restroom a minute ago, and it just looks cool because you can... I'm sorry, I'm going to do this. You can see all of Idaho wilderness out there. It looks awesome. It's just a cool place. The fonts are great. I love it. [A] I think we'll probably start in here just get a bit of a rundown of things. [D] All right. [A] This diagram helps me explain breeding just a little bit. There are two isotopes of uranium that occur naturally, 235 and 238. Uranium 235 is what's useful to us in a reactor. That's an a unstable atom, we can break it apart and harness the energy from that breaking. Unfortunately, 99. 3% of uranium is 238, which is too stable to be split, but you can use it to make plutonium. What you have to do is separate the 235 from the 238 until you've got a concentrated amount, and then you can build a breeder reactor. [D] Now, so you're breeding plutonium? [A] Yes, sir. [D] So you're making plutonium? [A] Mm-hmm. [D] And that's what's actually giving you, ultimately, the electricity? [A] Not in this case. The uranium 235 is running double duty. It splits. In the process of splitting, some of that mass has transformed directly into heat. That's what we're going to use to make electricity like a coal-burning plant. But it also releases neutrons, and we can use the excess fast neutrons that aren't needed for splitting extra uranium to breed plutonium. [D] Nuclear power is intimidating for people to understand, myself included. As a result of that, I have spent a lot of time with Flannel and googly eyes and 3D printing some stuff, and we're going to take a stab at understanding this, okay so, Andrew said there are two things going on at EBR-1. He said there's heating, and he also said there's breathing. These are two separate things. Heeding is how we make the electricity. Let's focus on that right now. We'll talk about breeding later. So how does a nuclear power plant, in this case, EBR-1, make heat? Let's start with a very important atom. It's uranium-235. And in this little example here, all the protons are red and the neutrons are blue. I want to introduce you to Our Hero. This is a fast neutron. And when you see this fast neutron, I want you to think of this. Wee Wee Wee!! [Destin laughs] It's so silly, but this is what makes nuclear power possible. So we've got this this fast neutron hitting uranium-235. Now, one thing to remember about uranium-235 is it's about 0.7% of all the uranium in the environment. The rest of it, what is it? 99.3%. Those are all different isotopes of uranium. So when this fast neutron hits uranium-235, it's not like a billiard ball, ballistically, like blowing up all the protons and neutrons. It's a different thing. It fundamentally changes the nature of this atom, and it's no longer uranium-235, it turns in to uranium-236. Now, I've got these different color googly eyes to represent the fact that uranium-236 is a little bit different. It's spicy. So uranium-236 It's really deep on the periodic table. There's a lot of forces at work. It doesn't want to hold itself together. It's not as stable as uranium-235. So this exists for a very short amount of time, and then something interesting happens. It actually splits. This is fission. It splits the atom into two new atoms. This is not a chemical reaction. This is fission. We are splitting that atom into two new atoms, and they're very surprised to exist. Of course, they are different atoms. We've got krypton, and we've got barium. So these new atoms exist. But the act of splitting that atom has a byproduct that's very, very important, and that is heat. So I'm going to add heat to the board here. So we've created two new atoms, and we've created all this heat. And if we're clever, we can use that heat to create electricity. But there's another thing that happens as well, and it's going to take me just a second to get all my heat on the board here. So we've got these new atoms. We've got all this heat, but there's something else that happens. We actually create three new fast neutrons, or I guess they kick off of the fission. So you've got these fast neutrons going off into space. Wee, wee, wee. They're just flying off. So So everything you see on the board here was in that uranium 235 atom when it was hit by one fast neutron. So if you think about it, we can think of that uranium 235 atom almost like a spring loaded mousetrap. It's got potential energy, and it's stored up, and it's even got these three extra fast neutrons over here. And when you hit it, it'll spring off and it'll do crazy things. So if we think about that, and then we cleverly arrange a bunch more uranium U235 atoms out here around that initial fission event, then we can do a really cool thing. With that fast neutron that's kicking off the splitting of the atom, it can go over here. And if there's another U235 atom in the proximity, it can slap it and trigger it, and then you create this whole thing all over again, creating heat and three more fast neutrons. Wee wee wee!! [mouse traps snapping] So by cleverly arranging U235 atoms around each other, scientists and engineers can create more fast neutrons from one fast neutron triggering a U235 atom. It's almost like a bunch of mousetraps ready to go. And if you cleverly arrange them, you can create heat at the rate that you want. So by controlling the proximity or the probability of the interaction of these fast neutrons with these other U235 atoms, scientists and engineers can control how much heat is created in the reactor, which is amazing. We're going to learn more from Andrew as we learn more about the plant, but I have some more felt stuff later that has electric motors attached to the board, and I think you're going to enjoy that. What's your deal, Andrew? Are you a student? What's your deal, man? I got to know. [A] So I'm a mechanical engineering student. I just have a deep love of history, so I wanted to work out here, get some public outreach before I'm stuck behind a desk. [D] You're not going to be stuck behind a desk being a mechanical engineer. You're going to be building awesome things, man, like reactors. [A] That's true. I'm more meant just... I get to I'll talk to people in interface with the public while I'm out here because there's so many misconceptions around this technology and its safety. But this is the first reactor ever really made to produce electricity, and it has a bunch of inbuilt safety features that most people wouldn't have even expected. [D] Is this how EBR That one worked? [A] Yeah, essentially. [D] So the reactor, and then that's liquid going through there. [A] Yeah, it's a liquid metal. It's a bit unique compared to most modern designs. We used a mixture of sodium and potassium. It's a liquid metal eutectic, which means if you get the right alloy, it has a lower melting point than either of the base elements. In this case, like mercury, it's liquid at room temperature. They had to use a liquid metal because water absorbs and slows down neutrons, and they needed fast neutrons to produce plutonium. So they had to find a way to make the liquid metal work, and that's why the system looks a bit weird. Technically- [D] Yeah, it usually goes from here to here. [A] Yeah. [D] And you don't have this loop right here. [A] Technically, to make this function, you wouldn't even need this middle loop, but it's there for a pretty good reason. If you were ever to have a breach between these two pipe systems that allow the two coolants to mix, you'd get a pretty big explosion. The alkaline liquid metal will basically rip the hydrogen off the oxygen in the H2O, so you do get an explosive reaction. They would not want that to be highly radioactive. So by splitting up the liquid metal loops this way, the highly radioactive coolant is sequestered in this first loop. That provides one level of safety. There's a second level that exists in the secondary heat exchanger. We'll talk about that downstairs. [D] All right, Andrew did a great job explaining everything, but selfishly, I just wanted to build it and play with it to understand it better. So that's what we're going to do. The first thing I want to talk about is the fact that they use liquid metal. That's a pretty big deal. So I purchased some Gallium, which is a room temperature liquid metal that you can just buy and play with. It's really fun to see a metal flow like a liquid. But why did they do that? That's a really strange design choice. So the fast neutrons, when they kick off of a uranium 235 atom, those things are going 14,000 kilometers per second. Very, very fast. The thing about fast neutrons is when they go through water, they slow down. So if you have just water like this, there's a bunch of hydrogen atoms in there, and that fast neutron will interact with them, and it'll slow down to 2 km/s. That's not good if you want to use this as a breeder reactor, which is what they wanted to do. So there's this other material called NAK, sodium and potassium. You can see how it gets its name right here, NA for sodium, K for NAK is not a moderator like that. So the fast neutrons will just zip through this, and it's also a really good conductor of heat. So it makes an ideal liquid to transfer heat away from the reactor. So the first two loops in EBR-1 were NAK, and the third loop was water. Now, just like Andrew said, that first loop is isolated from the second loop so that if you did have NAK come in contact with water because that doesn't work well, it It'll explode if that happens. If you have an explosion, you don't want it to be a radioactive explosion. So you isolate all the radioactive stuff over here in loop one. And then, well, let's just see, how do we get heat from the reactor all the way over there? So let's look inside of our loops here. You see, there's our reactor. That's just a heat exchanger. That's a heat exchanger with some steam in it. Okay, so let's look at how this works. So I've got this little setup here. I've got a little distribution panel so I can turn things on and off. I've got a bunch of motors and stuff behind the board there. I'm going to show you how this works. So first of all, let's turn our reactor on. I'm going to take this and move it up, and we'll understand why that turns the reactor on later. So our reactor is now running, and we are creating heat inside the reactor. The problem is if we just keep making heat over and over and over and never do anything with it, it'll just sit there and melt everything down. So we have to move the heat away from the reactor. And the way we do that is with NAK. So we're going to turn this little pump on here, and we're going to pump NAK through the system through this heat exchanger. So that gets us to the second loop. So the interface between loop one and loop two is basically a pipe within a pipe. That's a heat exchanger. So there mechanically isolated from a fluid perspective, but they're not thermally isolated. They're actually thermally coupled. Pipe within a pipe, that's a heat exchanger. And once we get here, we can just simply turn on another pump here and we can pump the heat over to the third loop. Now, the The third loop is important because we have water in there. When you heat up water past a certain point, as you know, you make steam. That steam can be converted to mechanical power. We're going to take thermal power move it all the way down and convert it to mechanical power by activating this turbine right here. At that point right there, we can use that to turn a generator and all kinds of things like that. As the steam goes through the turbine, it loses energy, and we can condense it back into water, and we can send it back into the loop. We can just use this loop right here over and over and over. And if we hook a generator up right there, we can actually create electricity. So that's what we're going to do right now. Let's hook up our... Let's just hook up those wires. And there we have it. Light. We have done it. We've created the world's first nuclear power plant. We've gone from nuclear power, thermal energy all the way to electricity. This is the world's first nuclear power plant, EBR-1. And remember, this is a fast reactor. There's two types of reactors, a fast reactor, which uses fast neutrons, or a thermal reactor, which uses a moderator which slows down the neutrons. That's not what EBR-1 was. And the reason they wanted a fast reactor is because of the breathing process, which we'll learn more about later from Andrew. But now that we know how all this works, let's go learn how they controlled it. [A] All right, let's take a look at the control room next. [D] I love your tour style, Andrew. It's great. You've refined it, haven't you? [A] Yeah, I've had a bit of practice out here. [Destin laughs] [D] All right. Is this control room? [A] Yeah, this is the control room. [D] Is this where originally, this is the original control room? [A] Yeah, essentially everything in here is original. There are a couple of pipe systems I've noticed throughout the building that changed as they updated the reactor core, but that's basically it. Everything else is in the position it had It started in the '50s. Primary coolant was metal. [A] Yep. [D] All of this these are measuring the temperature. [A] I love these paper graphs. They measure time radially, so 24 hours is a full circle and amplitude is measure from inside out. It's so simple and beautiful, and it makes perfect sense if they had to switch these out every day. [D] Yeah. Do you have any of the old blanks? [A] I don't know if we do or not. I'm sure that they exist somewhere, but I don't have access to them. Okay, so here is an actual drawing. Yeah, you can see it. It's pretty cool. Oh, midnight right there. Midnight. So what time is it right now? It is 2: 30-ish. So midnight would go 2: 30. So right here, that is the temperature at that time. I just don't know how to measure it. Okay. [A] Yeah, they're a bit hard to read, but there is something really nice about these old systems. I've had some old nuke's come through, and they tell me that with this very analog of recording data, it can be really intuitive for the human brain because you can look at the circle and see what portions of the data are larger or smaller as far as amplitude goes and read it very quickly. In a modern digital system, you'll have maybe a catalog of 10,000 entries for whatever the amplitude is you're recording. And oftentimes, that's harder to understand for the human brain than looking at something like this. You can pick trends out a lot quicker with this. [D] Okay, this is unrelated to nuclear power, but I think you'll enjoy it. So I am working on my PhD, and and as a part of the PhD, I'm trying to do what's called modeling and simulation of an event that I did back in the day. Two objects clashing together at a very high rate of speed. It's really fascinating. But what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to create a digital version of that event, and then I'm going to do what's called finite element analysis. Basically, I take the objects and I divide them up into little finite elements. And then when you do that, you can calculate the forces going in one of the triangles and then the force is going out, except it's in three-dimensional space. And then you can use that data to go back and you can measure with math, you can measure the stress all along the impact surface of these objects. Now, I'm doing this on a computer, which I want to go show you now. So let's go in there and check that out. Okay, this is my workstation. It's a special computer made by Puget Systems to run very complicated software. This is a piece of software called Ellis's Dina. Actually, this is Ansys, and I'm running LS Dina simulation on it. Now, the thing is, I can only run this simulation on this machine, and it takes a really long time to run the math. So today's sponsor is AnyDesk, which is remote desktop software for your computer, and you can check it out at anydesk.com/smarter. Anydesk is fantastic and easy to use software that lets you remotely control computers. You can do it from a laptop or you can do it from your phone. So recently, I had to travel up to the northeast, and while I was there, every chance I got, I wanted to check in on my simulation to see how it was doing. On this train, I can tether with my phone and I can remote in to my workstation back at home, and I can check on the simulation to see how it's running. I love it. Any desk has changed my life. I think there's something to be said for studying in a really cool room or doing some work in a really cool place, which is why I'm here at the New York Public Library. I'm able to run my workstation from a remote location and work on my PhD in a really cool room. I I know that sounds dumb, but it's really cool and I enjoy it. You should check out AnyDesk. In fact, the screen capture that you're looking at on the screen right now, I uploaded that back to my workstation, back home using AnyDesk. There's a file sharing system built into AnyDesk. I love AnyDesk. It's seamless, easy to use, and it lets me do complex stuff like this remotely. Anydesk. Com/smarter. It's free, and the way they make money is they assume you're going to love their software so much that you're going to convince employer to get a business license for the software. And I think you're going to like it because it enables you to get your time back and operate more efficiently. Check it out. Anydesk. Com/smarter. That's the data. It looks pretty cool. Thanks for considering. This is amazing. This is incredible. They hand-calibrated. [A] You'll see these notes all throughout the facility. Basically, every system, they were learning for the first time. So as they figured out how to it, they'd write notes so that the next person to do it basically had a baseline to work from. [D] This is incredible. What they're doing is they're calibrating. They have an analog measurement here and tank level in inches. This is a curve. And so this is how to read this. If I said I've got two amps, I would say two amps. Oh, that is 30, 35 inches is how much fuel is in my tank or whatever this What is in your tank? Primary drain tank. Okay, I appreciate this so much. I used to do instrumentation, and one of the first things we would do is we have to make the curve for your instrument, and you set the low-end and the high-end, and then you figure out how it all works. I've never seen that technique, and it's awesome. I'm sorry. That was a little too much geeking out there, Andrew. [A] Believe me, I'm all for it. [Destin laughs] [D] That's awesome. [A] Then there's one particularly important button I always like to talk about, and that is, of course, the Scram button. If I press this while the reactor was operational, it would be shut down in about four seconds. From the beginning of these reactor designs, they knew they had to be shut down quickly if the power was rising quicker than they could really ameliorate it in another sense. This system has two different ways of scramming. One of them would insert the control rods all the way and it would slow it down over time, and then it was ready to start up immediately. The other Scram system, which was, I think, pulled from this bully here, would drop the outside blanket immediately decreasing the reactivity to zero, and that would shut it down immediately. The only problem is they could not start back up quickly. They'd have to go through a process of making sure the blanket was good to go. Took about an hour before they could fully restart it. [D] That's a serious scram. This is the more graceful scram, and then this is the, Oh, heck. Let's grab that ring and pull it. [A] It used down a lot further, but kids thought it was fun to swing on. [D] Oh, yes, it goes up. Oh, that's interesting. It's in the middle of the room, so anybody could pull it. [A] Yeah. [D] Okay. I could spend too much time in here. Should we go to the next place? Time to talk about breeding. Now, reading is a very special thing. We can make nuclear fuel from nuclear fuel, and it starts with a uranium-238 atom. You remember when we were talking about uranium-235, this is about 0.7% of all the uranium you'll find in the world, whereas uranium-238 is more prevalent. It's about 99.3%. Now, when we did the fission thing earlier and we kicked off these little fast neutrons, when a fast neutron comes in contact, wee, with uranium-238, that creates uranium-239. You can tell from his eyes that he's just a little bit spicy, right? So the uranium-239 exists for a while, but then about 23 minutes later, give or take, we have a really interesting thing that happens. We kick off an electron, and we have this process called beta decay that happens inside the atom. Some neutrons and protons, they'd switch rolls. It's strange. And then we end up creating, as a result of this beta decay, neptunium-239, completely different element. You can tell he's very different. So after this time, we have another beta decay event. That beta decay event happens around 2-3 days later. We kick off one more electron. We have some stuff happen in the nucleus again. And then we create the ultimate spicy element, which is plutonium 239 that comes into existence. Now, the thing about this process is you're making nuclear fuel from nuclear fuel. And in fact, you can make more atoms of plutonium 239 than put in to begin with of uranium 235, which is a very special trait for a nuclear reactor to have. In order to do all this, you have to get a fast neutron to hit the nucleus of a U238 atom, so it becomes U239. But that doesn't happen all the time. Sometimes these fast neutrons bounce off, and the engineers and scientists that designed EBR-1 used that to actually run the reactor. It was pretty interesting what they did. [A] Let's head out this door and see the reactor itself. [D] What? [A] Very close by. [D] This is it? [A] Yep. It doesn't look like much, but this is a relatively small reactor. So right now we're standing on the radiation shield for the reactor. I would call it a containment vessel, but technically they're a bit different. Containment vessels are essentially meant to hold in the products if they have a meltdown. This is just a big radiation shield. Normally, there'd also be a big plug right here that would prevent radiation from coming out of the core. But now that it's been decommissioned, they can safely take that plug out and let us look inside. The core itself is just below that machinery. We'd feed fuel rods into it through that machinery, and the core is set up using these hexagonal assemblies. The center seven contain the uranium 235 that's propagating the chain reaction, while the outside ring of hexagonal assemblies contains 238 to breed plutonium. There's not uranium in all 10 feet of these rods. It's only in the eight and a half inch heat zone near the bottom, about a football-size zone. That's where all that reaction would take place. For this particular reactor, they operated using about 60 kilograms of fuel, and that means that there wasn't enough for it to go critical by itself. That's why this outside breeding blanket was necessary. It acted as essentially a reflector. It's made of 84 bricks of uranium-238. They're set up in this cup shape on an elevator just below the reactor core. The hydraulic elevator would bring that up around the core when it was ready to turn on. It'll reflect neutrons back inside and give you enough neutron flux for the reaction to occur. So we didn't use control rods for startup and shutdown. We use this for startup and shutdown. [D] That blanket. Okay, remember our board with all the stuff on it? I'm going to put you on this tripod right here so we can look at how to start up and shut down the reactor. All right, so let's check it out. So as we raise the blanket, we start the nuclear reaction. And to stop the reaction, we just drop the blanket. That's how this works. So we have a physical control now for nuclear power, and that's how they came with that. And to explain what exactly is going on there, I'm going to have to change out the board to the other board. So let me do that now. Okay, let's build the reactor from the top down. So over here on the right, this is the top down view of the reactor. The red is U235 enriched. The outside is U238. Over here, we've got the U235 atom and the U238. So this is like the conceptual model. This is the top down view of the reactor. So let's look at how this works. So So when we get a fission event from U235, we're kicking off those three neutrons, right? Those three fast neutrons. Wee, wee, wee!! They're flying out here. They're going really fast, right? Sometimes they will interact with the U238, and you might get breeding. So if you look at over here, that would be leaving U235 and interacting with the U238 atoms out here in this inner blanket, they call it, right? So when it does that, sometimes it'll create plutonium, sometimes it'll bounce it back into the U235 to sustain the fission reaction. However, because of the arrangement, sometimes these neutrons, they don't hit anything and they just keep going. That's what the blanket is for. If we were to put a neutron mirror, let's think about it like that right there, there. And on the top down view like that, then this is what happens. So if the fast neutron flies, it misses the U238 and it keeps going and it hits this big wall of U238 atoms, right? These bricks of U238, it hits this wall, it reflects, then it will bounce back, and that increases the statistical probability that it's going to hit a U235 atom. So your chances of sustaining a fission reaction goes way up because you're getting two shots with those neutrons, right? Well, maybe not two because some of them just keep going, but you get the idea. So it leaves the inner core. It goes past the inner breathing blanket, which is cooled by liquid metal, NAK, if you recall. And then it goes out to the outer breathing blanket, and then it sometimes will bounce back into the core. That's why applying... If I did this, then it's very unlikely that it's going to bounce back. But if I did this, then we're going to bounce neutrons back into the core. That's why raising and lowering the breeding blanket is so important, and that's why they could turn on and off the reaction. If they balance the amount of U238 and where it is and how many neutrons can go where, they can just flip a switch and turn on or off the reactor, which is fascinating. That would come up and down? [A] Yep. Originally, they had it set up so it can only be fully up or fully down, but they realized that that wasn't ideal, so they added in some hydraulic control systems so you can get more fine-tuning. This is also where our control rods would go into. We did have eight control rods, but they'd go into the outside blanket for fine-tuning. As the reactivity of these rods decreases over the nine-month lifespan, they'd pull the control rod so they could get the same power out. [D] The outer blanket would move up and down? [A] Yes, sir. [D] If comes up, what happens? [A] If you bring it up, it'll increase reactivity until eventually you reach criticality and the reaction starts. [D] Because it's reflecting neutrons back in towards the fuel? [A] Yep. This is also breeding plutonium. That's why it was made of uranium-238. [D] Okay. You have to lift it in order for it to activate, and so gravity is your friend. Yep, and that's why our Scram system works in an incredibly simple way. When they scram this facility, rather than dropping control rods into the core, which is how it works for almost all modern facilities, it'll empty the hydraulic systems that hold the breeding blanket up and drop that down into the basement. [D] So it just opens a valve? [A] Yep. [D] Okay. [A] That would shut it down in about four seconds, but it would take an hour to restart if they scrammed it that way. That's why they had two separate scram systems. [D] Are these actual fuel rod assemblies? [A] I think these are just mock-up assemblies and rods, but they are all exactly the size of the originals. [D] That's cool. And there was fluid in there, I'm assuming. Was there water? [A] Not water. This would be the liquid metal cool part of the system. Right up here on top under the plug, there would be a layer of argon gas. That would prevent oxygen from ever getting down into the coolant. It could ignite the coolant if it comes into contact with air due to the oxygen. This would be filled with of Argon, and there's argon in a couple of other systems that we'll see as well. [D] Is argon heavier than air? [A] Yeah, I believe so. For the case of argon, it acts essentially as a noble gas th",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
t's completely non-reactive. That way, you won't have anything reactive come into contact with the coolant. [D] That's awesome. That's cool. Where to now, Andrew? [A] All right, let's go take a look at the generator where they powered the first light bulbs to ever be powered using nuclear energy. [D] Look at this. That's not actually true right now, is it? [A] Not anymore. [D] So that was true at the time, though, right? [A] Yeah, and it was also a huge point of pride to the men working here. It's important to remember that they had just come from the Manhattan Project, meaning their work had recently been used in Japan to kill thousands of civilians at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Whether or not it was the right choice to drop that bomb is not that I ever pretend to know or tell people. That's not really something I can decide because I wasn't there at the time. [D] Come on, Andrew. I'm putting all of that on you. [A] But really, they cared about producing power. They knew this could be an energy future for the world, and it mattered to them that they were on the other side of that coin. That sign was a point of pride because of that. From what I understand, they would never turn that sign on unless the reactor was producing electricity, and they would shut that off before they shut the reactor down every night. They really did care about that being true. They cared about it. [D] That's awesome. It was It's almost like plowshares. You're familiar with the verse in the Bible beating their swords in the plowshares? Have you heard of that? [A] Swords to plowshares. [D] Yeah, the plowshares project. That was a whole different thing for people. That's great. [A] All right, next we'll head out to the generator. A reactor only has one job. In the case of BBR-1, it's got two to produce both heat and plutonium. Through our heat exchange system, we boil water. We send the superheated steam up through the back of turbine to spin it up. Then through this Gearbox, the generator spun up even faster to produce electricity. [D] This is the Gearbox? [A] Yes, sir. [D] Okay. [A] On the 20th of December 1951, for the first time, they had all their systems in place. They had been turning on the reactor since about August, but they were finally ready to make electricity. On that first day, Dr. Walter Zinn, the lead for the project, wanted to start small, so he just strung up four 300 Watt light bulbs, connected those to the generator, and when they turned the reactor on for the first time to produce electricity using uranium for the first time, they just powered on four light bulbs. The next day, they connected it to the rest of the facility, and it would power the whole building going forward. [D] That's amazing. But this was the moment? [A] Yep. [D] Is this a photo of the moment? [A] Yep. [D] Really? [A] Afterwards, Reed Cameron thought that they needed to commemorate the occasion. So he got out a ladder and some chalk. He wrote this excerpt up on the wall, and everybody signed their names underneath it to commemorate the event. [D] That's the original? [A] Yep. They encased it pretty soon after they signed. [D] Electricity was first generated here from atomic energy on December 20th, 1951. On December 21st,1951, all the electrical power in the building was supplied from atomic energy. Those present, and those are all the people that participated. [A] Jolly signed a few days later. He was the local janitor. [D] Jolly did? [A] Yup, that's the name on the bottom there. But I think everybody else signed that first day. [D] That is a moment. What is the picture? [A] Reid thought it looked boring, so he got back up there. He drew the character blowing air on top. Nobody knows exactly what it is, but literature and some of the memoirs from the men who worked here is that they figure it's the devil blowing air, creating energy. Personally, it seems like their way of saying this thing that's been used as a horrible weapon can also be used to create power. But I can't attribute that to anything in specific. That's more of a me thing. [D] That's awesome. This would have been powered with water. Where are the heat exchangers that take the heat out of the liquid and turn into water? [A] We'll see those next. They're right below us. [D] Okay, let's do it. You guys are filling up. A lot of people are visiting. [A] Yep, it gets pretty busy around this time normally. [D] Does it really? [A] Through this door here is the secondary heat exchanger. It might seem like an awfully big system for a 45 kilowatts worth of electricity, but that's because it's a safe design, not a spatially efficient design. It's a pipe within a pipe heat exchanger. The innermost pipe carries the liquid metal coolant from the middleman loop. Around that is a filled with argon gas, the totally noble nonreactive gas we've talked about before. Then around that is the pipe carrying water to be heated, boiled, and sent up to the turbine. [D] So the heat has to go through the argon? [A] Yeah. That's why it's so big, because argon is not particularly conductive. But the argon is there for a good reason. If you do have a pipe breach on either side, you don't want the coolants to come into to mix that will cause an explosion. So instead, they'll only be able to mix with argon, which is completely nonreactive. That's why you have the jacket between those two layers. So I always stop here just for a moment. There's not too much to see in here, but this is the primary coolant loop feeding coolant right from the reactor. I do like to note the thickness of this wall. A lot of people have the misconception that these early nuclear scientists would have received high doses of radiation working at these plants. That was true for some experiments that they operated, but not for the plant itself. This wall is 4 feet thick to act as gamma radiation shielding. They knew, based on studies they've been doing in Japan, that they had to shield from that radiation, and you need a minimum of 4 feet of water or high density concrete or three feet of lead to mitigate those effects. That's why this wall is so thick. [D] That's concrete. Oh, yeah, those are not concrete. Excuse me, those are not cinder block bricks, they're concrete bricks. [A] Yep. [D] Okay. [A] This right to my left is the cask that would allow us to pull spent fuel rods out of the reactor. It's a lead-lined container that helps trap the radiation within. The tank on the back of it fills it with argon so that when they pull the fuel rods, there's no oxygen interacting with the liquid metal coolant. They'd have to pull it one rod at a time, so it was a pretty lengthy process. [D] So they would put something down in there, grab a rod and pull it out? [A] Yeah. Basically, they'd take this 10-ton crane above us in the corner. They'd hoist this cask up on top of the reactor, and it would sit on this plug, but this would be upstairs where the hole in the reactor we saw is. It's just right up there. They'd be able to rotate this plug, and then through these three hatches, they could gain access to the different parts of the reactor and pull just a single rod out at a time. [D] That's cool. [A] Once they have the single rod out, they'd close up the top of the reactor, close up the bottom of the cask and move the rest or move the whole cask for cleaning and storage. [D] And so they could just store the rods? [A] They had to store the rods. The daughter products within them, when you take this big atom of uranium and break it in half, those two daughter products are unstable. When they break down, they don't just release radiation, they also release heat, so the rods keep themselves hot for a long time. You have to store them before you can ever do work on them. That way, they have time to cool. [D] Oh, wow. So there's a lot of thermal capacity there. [A] Oh, yeah. [D] Fuel rods. Is this where they would store them? [A] This is where they store the fuel rods before they went into the reactor. The vault here might make it seem like you needed a bunch of shielding. Really, the vault's just to prevent anybody from gaining access if they're not supposed to, and for accountability. At the time, we were shipping all of our uranium from Africa. The military wasn't certain that we'd be able to continue those shipments, so they kept a very tight track of essentially every ounce of uranium. We'd bring it here from Hanford, we'd weigh it before it went into the vault. If we ever needed, let's say, three pounds of replacement fuel, we'd We have to weigh it very carefully before we took it out of the vault. So this helps us keep track of all the uranium that we're using. [D] But they could just store the actual rods out in the open like that? [A] Yeah, you don't need any special shielding for natural uranium. This is concentrated 235, so it's not natural in the sense that it's pulled right out of the ground. But this hasn't started fissioning, which means almost all the radiation it produces is in the form of alpha particles, which will be stopped by your skin. You'd have to breathe this uranium in or swallow it for it to cause you cancer. And at that point, you've got other issues because it's a heavy, toxic metal. It's pretty benign in this form. The reason you have to be so much more careful once we pull it out of the reactor is because of those daughter products. When you take that big atom and split it in half, its instability will cause it to release radiation as it breaks down. That's the more dangerous form of radiation we have to be careful about. [D] Andrew, have you memorized this or are you just shooting from the hip right now? [A] A bit of both. [D] Really? [A] It's not my exact tour schedule. [D] But you actually know this stuff. [A] Yeah. [D] And you love it? [A] Oh, of course. [D] Okay, great. That's awesome. All right. [A] I mean, this facility really is the perfect mixture of engineering and history for me. My two biggest passions, so I love this place. [D] It's awesome, dude. Andrew really is a remarkable tour guide, and he showed me a ton of more fascinating stuff. And I'm going to put that over on Smarter Every Day 2, because I don't want this video to be an hour long. For example, he explained to me that EBR-1 had a partial meltdown one time, but they knew this could happen, and they were testing the safety systems so that they could roll that forward into future reactor design. They used this event to learn about how to clean up after something like this occurs, which they clearly did because I'm standing in the facility. He took me downstairs and he showed me where they worked on the rods and the blanket to inspect them and repair them. They had to build impressive machinery to move these things around while they're radioactive, reactor parts. It's fascinating stuff. He also took me outside and showed me these two reactors. These were intended to be part of a jet airplane. The government ended up abandoning that program, which is probably the right idea, but it's pretty awesome. And I'm going to put that all over on Smarter Every Day 2. So please check out that video. I'm really grateful to Andrew for sharing his passion with me. This was a lot of fun. I hope you are half as excited as I am about the Nuclear Power Deep Dive series because I wanted to understand nuclear power forever, and we're finally getting to do it. So this is what I'm going to ask. Typically, I would say there's a lot of videos here. Please consider subscribing to Smarter Every Day, but I don't think that works like it used to on YouTube. So what I'm going to ask is, would you consider signing up for Smarter Every Day email updates? You can do that at the link down in the video description, smartereveryday.com/emaillist or something like that. If you would consider that, I would greatly appreciate it. I will notify you when a new video from the Nuclear Power Deep Dive series comes out. These videos are incredible. We filmed them at Idaho National Labs, but there's all kinds of stuff. We're looking at this special glass-blowing thing. How do you measure the temperature of a reactor? What happens when you have waste that you have to handle? How do you do that? These are really, really neat videos, and I think you're going to love them, so go check that out. So, yeah, that's it. Please consider subscribing to Smarter Every Day via the email list. And a big thank you to everybody that supports Smarter Every Day on Patreon. I'm trying to make intelligent, respectful content that I think should exist on the internet, so please consider that as well down in the link. Last thing, I've got a link below to a form. If you have access to a currently working nuclear power plant, I'm trying to get into one, and that's proving to be difficult. Also, if you have other things in the nuclear industry you think I should consider, then there's a form down in the video description. If you click that and fill that out, I would really appreciate that. Anyway," that's it. I'm Destin. You're getting Smarter Every Day. Nuclear power. Let's do it. Have a good one. Bye.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lylCYkgC63Q,The Backwards Brain Tractor - Smarter Every Day 305,,Educational,"[Tractor engine running] Good news! I fixed the tractor. Except, watch this. [Destin laughing hysterically] Hilarious. It's like the backwards brain bicycle only a tractor. Oh, man. Oh, golly. The steering cylinder was out. Actually, I've been amazed at how quickly my brain has adapted because of the bicycle. Seriously. I can do it. It's really, kinda fun. The steering cylinder had a leak, and I got it repaired. I'll show you what I did. Put it in neutral. It's pretty easy mistake. These are swapped. I got to fix that. Being a country boy is awesome. Oh, that's reversed. My bad. Okay, I have a little announcement here I'm going to make. But first, if you're not familiar with the concept of the backwards brain bicycle, that's it. And years ago, I made this video. It's pretty cool because it's got this set of gears on top. And when you turn the handlebars one way, the wheel will go the opposite direction. So the thing about this is it's very, very hard to ride. Your brain has a hard time getting over your own brain, and it's fascinating. Had I realized at the time that I made that video that so many people all over the world would be able to relate to that video and understand cognitive bias in a new way because of this metaphor, I would have changed the video just a little bit. For example, there's one moment in the video where I say it took me eight months to learn how to ride this bike. In two weeks, he did something that took me eight months to do. I would just get on the bike, up at the driveway, up and back every so often. But yeah, that took about eight months, but I wasn't locked in. And what I found over the years that I've had friends that have come up to this thing and they've locked in. They're like, give me the bike. I'm angry because I can't ride it. I'm going to focus and I'm going to learn how to do it. And they are able to do it in a few days. And that's fascinating to me. There's something about the quality of the dedication you have to the learning of the thing that affects your ability to do it, I think that's fascinating. Years ago, I wanted to test this. So I mailed one to Mike Boyd and challenged him to learn it by locking in and seeing what he could do. He learned it in an hour, which is absolutely remarkable. Now, Mike is not normal. He has the ability to learn very complicated things quickly, and he has some other skills that probably helped him along the way. But at the end of this video, I'll tell you about a common thread between people who can do this instantly or in minutes, at least. There's been a lot of academic articles written using this as a metaphor, and there's something there, because I'm not a neuroscientist or anything, there's something about how focused you are on the learning that affects your ability to do something like this. Now, there's also something like when I got on the tractor, the backwards tractor, When I got on that thing, I instantly could do it. I didn't have to learn anything. I already had that neural pathway in my head. In fact, somebody asked me last night, Can you still ride that bicycle? And the answer is yes. In fact, I have this really cool bicycle, and you can just ride it in normal bicycle mode, or you can pull this pin and change it to backwards brain bicycle mode, and I can ride it in both modes. What's interesting is when I hop on this bike, I'm wobbly for a foot or so, and then my brain will pick which algorithm I'm supposed to be using, and I can just do it. It's fascinating, which tells me that once you learn this, you keep it. Now, some people that I know, they've tried to learn this stuff, and they didn't stick with it very much, so it's harder for them to keep the skill, but it seems to be something that persist once you build that pathway in your brain. Big thank you to Jonathan, Manon, and Mike, who reached out and offered to help many years ago, so they engineered and built this interchangeable bicycle. Thank you so much, guys. I appreciate it. Okay, it's time for the announcement. Every year here on Smarter Every Day, I create what's called the Smarter Every Day Sticker Team, and it's my way of saying thank you to the patrons of Smarter Every Day. That support at Patreon.com/smartereveryday. I thank people for sticking with me. They're stickers. You get it? It's a dad joke. Anyway, So it's also my way of trying to create artificial scarcity. So basically, if you jump on the sticker team, you're a part of that year's sticker team. For example, the first year, we were the supersonic baseball sticker team. After that, we were the JWST space team. We've done the Exploration team. This year, we have three stickers because we figured out during the space team years that people like the little stickers, too. People have sent me photos of them sticking these stickers all over things. For example, this year's first small sticker, there's three stickers, this year's first small sticker is good for playing pranks on people. For example, let's say your son were to buy a water bottle and it were to come in the mail and you were to intercept it before he got it. So the first sticker is a cicada. Now, we had a cicada thing happen this year in the US. And so this looks like a cicada with a white border. That doesn't look real, does it? But what you realize is this is actually a transparent sticker, and it actually looks like a cicada. So when you put it on something, it makes you do a double take. You're like, Wait, what is that? It looks really cool. So when you put this thing on a wall somewhere, it looks like some random thing is stuck there and it confuses people. And I have had way more fun with these stickers than I care to admit. They're really, really cool. So that's the first sticker. The second sticker, you may recall during the Eclipse this year, I worked really hard to take this really cool film photo on one piece of film. Now, I tried to get that sticker on... I tried to get that image on a sticker. It didn't quite work out, so we made a graphic representation of it. This form factor is pretty cool. This long sticker ends up working really well on a laptop or maybe on a lunch box or something like that. But I really enjoy seeing where people put their stickers. People have sent in photos over the years of where they put their stuff, and I'm excited to see where people end up putting this sticker. The big sticker this year, the name of the team, this year we're calling it the Smarter Every Day Discovery Team, and it's just a hodgepodge of all the stuff we've studied this year on Smarter Every Day. We've got the cicadas, we launched a rocket, we've got the eclipse. It's a really cool sticker to commemorate what we've done this year together. I would love it if you would consider supporting Smarter Every Day on Patreon at Patreon.com/smartereveryday. It's a really big deal because when you support... I'm trying to pick up a cicada. Because when you support Smarter Every Day on Patreon, that frees me from the pressures of the algorithm, allows me to take the time to make videos about things I really, really like. So there's a few videos I did this year that I knew weren't going to perform well in the algorithm, but they were very important to me. And I think authenticity is key. And I want to continue to make intelligent, respectful content. And I'm grateful to everybody that supports on Patreon because you really allow me to do that. So everybody that's supporting by the end of the year, I'm physically going to mail you these stickers to your house and you'll get to do whatever you want with them. You got to stick them somewhere because you can't just put a sticker in a drawer. It needs to be stuck. That's what stickers want to do. So anyway, thank you so much, everybody that supports on Patreon, Patreon.com/smartereveryday. I think a good way to end this video is to drive some more backwards things, in this case, the backwards tractor. Here we go! Put it in gear. Go forward, turn the wheel to the left. The tractor goes to the right [Destin laughing] Oh, man. Oh. Is that good? That's hilarious. I got to go switch those hoses now, but for the time being, it's very funny. So good. I thought you'd enjoy that. I'm Destin, you're getting Smarter Every Day. Have a good one, hah! Okay, I came out here to shoot the thumbnail for the video, and it was out of steering fluid, even though I swapped the connectors. So clearly, I have a hard time getting this tractor running. But a couple of things I wanted to say. While preparing this video, I realized that there are a lot of people that have made videos about the Backwards Brain bicycle. There's one guy on YouTube, his name is Laser Saber. He made a video about being able to ride it almost immediately. And also Carl, who did the remote control helicopter stuff for us during the helicopter series way back in the day, he could do it very quickly. People that seem to be able to ride the bike immediately all have one thing in common. They're drone pilots. They seem to be able to do this way quicker than most people. I think that has something to do with the fact that they invert things in their head. They can fly things inverted. I thought that was really cool. I just wanted to note that. Turns out power steering systems like fluid. That's good. Also, that nut is loose there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
jDusS--bZZA,The Incredibly Unique Triple Barreled Pistol...  - Smarter Every Day 304,,Educational,"[D] This is my son and I love him very much and I'm very proud of you. Do you know that you're, you know all that? [S] I do [D] You think the Internet knows that I'm proud of you? [S] No. Well, now they do. [D] Now they do. Okay, cool. Would you like to explain what we have here? [S] We have a single barrel pistol, a double barrel pistol and then a triple barrel pistol. [D] A what? [S] Triple barrel pistol. [D] Okay. I found these pistols at an antique shop and I thought about them for a really long time and eventually I just had to drive back. So this one, very, very old single barrel pistol. The tag on it says it's a British double action percussion cap, 1830. That is extremely old. The second one here, double barrel. What I really like about this one is somebody put their initials on there. I think that's really, really cool. The tag on this one says it's a Belgium made double derringer from the 1850s. That's incredibly old. I've never shot pistols, this old. And this one right here, I think this is fascinating. I've heard this referred to as a duck foot pistol because it kind of looks like a duck foot. Also, it's for clearing the deck on a boat if you're getting overrun by pirates. At least that's what I read. And a buddy of mine when he first saw this thing, his name for it I really like was the crowd pleaser. These things operate with what's called a percussion cap. Basically, I'll show you on the double here. So if I pull back the hammers, you can see underneath the hammers there, there's a thing called a nipple. You put a percussion cap on there and when you pull the trigger it falls and slams into that percussion cap. Now this double is pretty interesting because it's got two triggers. I can fire them one at a time or both of them at the same time with this trigger over here. Watch this. So we've got powder, we've got bullets and we've got patches. So here's a lead ball we're going to try to load. But first, this is powder made for pistols. So I read where you're supposed to do no more than 20 grains of powder. So that's a powder measuring tool. We got it set to about 10. So go ahead and get some powder in that thing. We're going to make a mess. I don't have a funnel. Got 10 grains of powder. [S] Need a little bit more. [D] Alright, now just pour it in the barrel. This is cool. [S] It's really cool. [D] Alright, now if you tip that Over. It's going to fall, right? Yes, sir. [D] So here's a really cool thing that we're going to do. So we're going to put this patch right over that, okay? Now put that lead ball right on top of that. Now push it down in with your thumb. See if it goes. Does it go? [S] Not really. [D] Not really? Let me see. Kind of. Kind of thump it right there. All right, keep going. Don't break the handle, but just keep going. You want to compress it all the way. [S] Will the powder go off? [D] No, no. The powder's not as sensitive as the primer. Did it go down anymore? [S] Yes, sir. [D] It looks pretty good. It's kind of scary, isn't it? [S] Yes, sir. I don't. I don't want it to go off! [D] All right, pull that rod out. All right, so we got the high speed camera. Let me get it set up so we can get a shot. I want to be the guy to fire this because if it doesn't work, I don't want you to get hurt. [S] That's fair. Not like it's from the 1850s or something like that. [D] Right. So I'm going to load this thing. So I'm going to put the. The percussion cap on the nipple. You know what? I'm going to hide behind titanium. I'm just going to be safe. This thing's old. Does it look in focus? [S] It looks like the end of the gun is in focus. Like your hand and stuff isn't. [D] Tell me what to do. [S] Go forward. Keep going. A little bit more. There you go. There you go. Stop, stop. [D] I have no idea if this is going to function. Ready? Yes, sir. 1830S black powder. 10 grains. 3, 2, 1. [gun shot] It feel like it shot. [S] I pushed the button. I saw Smoke and I pushed the button. [D] Man, that was so ridiculous. That was like the nerdiest way to shoot a gun ever. Open that thing up. [S] Oh, it loosened it. [D] Oh, did it? [S] It did. [D] All right. Did it go? Is it clear? [S] It's clear. [D] Let's see what the slow-mo says. Oh, looks like we did have problems. Looks like the sensor wigged out here. So you gonna shoot it this time? [S] Sure. [D] That's pretty funny. [S] Let's do it then. [D] I love you. All right, so. All right, get in position. You need a percussion cap? [S] I have one. [D] have ears in? [S] Yes, sir. [D] All right, load your percussion cap. Let me get my ears in. [S] Percussion cap is loaded. [D] Okay, ready? [S] Ready. [D] You look awesome. [Son] 3, 2, 1. [gun shot] [D] Got it. I saw the, I saw the patch come out. [S] I saw that too. And I also saw it hit like a leaf over there. [D] Oh, did you really? [S] Like it hit something and a bunch of leaves fell. [D] Okay, clear the gun. Obviously it is clear, but that's just what we do. Okay, look at that. [click] [then low rumble with cap igniting] [like someone softly hit a gong and its ringing out] [soft explosion sound as the gunpowder ignites] [D] As soon as it hits, look, the cap blows the hammer up. You see that? [S] Oh, yes, sir. [D] And so then it's lighting the powder inside. Takes quite a bit. There's. It feels like a delay when you pull the trigger, doesn't it? Oh, wow. So you have the cap hit. Oh. And then the powder goes. So you got the ignition. And then once the powder goes, it blows the hammer up. [S] So the hammer is going up three times. Once the hit the primer. Once the primer goes off, it goes up. Other once the powder explodes, it goes up again. [D] It does, doesn't it? That's pretty neat. I think we moved to the double. [S] All right. Is it weird? Loading two at once? [S] It's kind of scary. [D] I'm gonna be real with you, son. You look pretty awesome. [S] Thanks, dad. [D] Three, two, one, fire. Okay, now we don't know if they both went. That's the interesting thing about this gun. So. [S] Then pull the trigger again? [D] Just as a safety? Yeah, why not. So another one went? [S] Yeah. [D] But it didn't sound like the thing went. [S] Sounded like the percussion cap went.. [D] But not the... Oh, wow. What an interesting predicament. So we don't know. Good thing we have a high speed camera. So we're going to assume one of these barrels is loaded, right? [S] Yep. [D] Okay. All right, let's see what happened. [soft click sound] [louder click sound] [mini explosion sound as the gun powder ignites] [D] The left one fired. The right one did not go. Go put a percussion cap on the right one. See if you can make it go. Just clear to. Just clear the weapon. [gun shot] [S] Percussion cap, [D] huh? [S] That was only percussion cap. [D] But the ber... Oh, man. We have an issue, don't we? It's time for the nipple pick. [Destin Laughing] I bought a nipple pick. [S] Should that fire it? [D] Huh? [S] Is that gonna fire it? [D] No, I'm. I'm just trying to get a path to the powder. Try to clear it. Yep. Three, two, one. [S] Only percussion cap. [D] So we're gonna. We're gonna assume that there's powder and a. And a ball in there, right? So we'll flood it later with water. Did papa bring his donkey? [S] He brought his donkey. [D] You bringing Miss Pearl over here? He wanted her on video, didn't he? Okay, we're gonna move on because I don't know how to clear that right now. Got it out. We're gonna take a donkey break. Is this Miss Pearl? [Papa] Miss Pearl. [D] Hey, Miss Pearl. I've got a special camera. People have been taking pictures of people and donkeys for a long time. Oh, yeah, Got it. That'd be fine. [S] I like those pictures. [D] Yeah, they're neat, aren't they? [S] Is this percussion cap going to be bigger? [D] Yes. [S] What is this for? [D] So like in the Civil War, they would do this. They would. They had your rifle, you would take it. And if you had your rifle going, you'd go wham. And you'd stick a new percussion cap on. Pretty interesting, isn't it, huh? What I think's so interesting about this is you got a single percussion cap that goes down through the nipple and lights off the powder. But on this one, it's like a manifold, right? [S] Has to be. [D] So I put air on it back at the shop. I held this back and I put air pressure there and just made sure, oh, look at that. The nipple's a little loose. And I made sure I was getting airflow out of each one. So it'll communicate. There's gotta be like a pipe back here in the back, Right. Do you like doing that? [S] It's kind of fun. [D] Yeah. [S] I don't think I could do it if somebody was shooting at me though. [D] Yeah. I think a cartridge bullet style design is a pretty good thing. [S] So they go all the way down to the blocks. [D] So the bullets down in the block? [S] On the left, on the left and the right side. [D] Okay. [S] But if you go to the middle one, it goes like down into the block. [D] Interesting. Okay, I'm going to shoot the triple first. [S] Looks good here. [D] Okay, Red circle? [S] Red circle and looks good there. [D] Will you hand me this plate of titanium right here? [S] Yes, sir. I'm ready. [D] Three, two, one. Oh, gosh. That was scary. Could have a smoldering thing there. I'm gonna hold it for a second. You ready on the trigger? [S] Ready. [D] 3, 2, 1. Man [S] Did not push it. [D] 3, 2, 1. This isn't great. [S] Do a big cap with some powder under it. [D] Yeah. 1. [S] I really want this to work. [D] I want to work so bad, dude. Three, two, one. [gun shot] something happened. [S] I hit the button! [D] You hit the button? It felt like a single cylinder. Went. [explosion sound] 1, 2. The other one went too. That's just a mess dude. [explosion sound] Do, you want to load her back up? [S] I really want to [D] load that thing up. 15 each. Did you pick the nipple? [S] Not yet. [D] Here's your nipple pick. It's a clean looking nipple right there, man. You know, it's an important thing for a son to learn proper nipple hygiene from his dad. [S] Mhmm. [D] Do you feel that way? [S] I feel like you've taught me how to clean my nipples properly. [Destin laughing] [D] Okay. [S] Three, two, one. [just the cap went] [D] That scared me. All right, load another cap. [S] Three, two, one. It's getting annoying. The pirates have already taken our ship. Over. Ready in 3, 2, 1. [D] What do you think we do? [S] I mean, if we were pirates, we'd die. [Destin laughing] [D] That's exactly. We'd get swash buckled real hard right now, wouldn't we? [S] We would. [D] Dadgum it. [S] Ready in three, two, one. [Gun shot!] [D] Made sure to. [S] Let's go. Did you push that time? [D] Yes, sir, I did. [S] Let's go. [D] Look at that. Fizzle, fizzle, fizzle, boooooom. [S] So cool. [D] Oh, dude. [S] Is it like. [D] Oh, sick. Come here. [Explosion sound followed by gong ringing] [Destin once again laughing] Oh, man. Look at that. The lock time is forever. I'll calculate it later. We don't have time to calculate right now, but it. It's clearly smoldering for a while before it goes. [S] Like, how long? [D] Milliseconds. Tens of milliseconds. The sponsor's ridge. What if we put three ridge wallets up there and you try to hit all three of them? [S] We can try. [D] You think you can do it? [S] I don't know. Maybe. Depends on how far away they are. [D] Ridge is the sponsor for this video, which really excites me because I love my ridge wallet. I didn't think I would, but I love this thing. It's so small, and it's really easy to get to your cards. And I like the airtag money clip. This is a thing that helps me find my wallet when I misplace it, which is a really big deal in my life. So I asked them if you could get an airtag money clip for free. So if you go to ridge.com/smarter if you buy certain styles and a certain amount, it's on the website. You can figure it out. You're smart. But I highly recommend getting the airtag money clip. Also, they have many different sizes and styles. You can get them made out of leather. There's carbon fiber. There's even these minimalist wallets. So this is basically the smallest wallet that can exist if you think about the size of credit cards. So check it out. Ridge.com/smarter. For now, it's time to go shoot these things. My son has a few minutes left before he has to go to a dance. Why are you gonna go to a dance? You could just still be doing this with me. [S] I kind of want to still be doing this with you. [D] Whatever, dude. So what's the plan here? You gonna walk me through it? [S] I'm gonna have to line the middle barrel up here and try to find Like a distance back to where these barrels are. About in the same position. [D] Oh, in. In the outside, because you have a fixed spread. Like, that would be too close. So let's back up. Back up with me. So as you go back, the pie spreads out and is, like, right there, for example. That's interesting. And there's also a component of this that matters. So this is like planar aiming, isn't it? [S] Yes, sir. I'd be lucky if I hit one. [D] Yeah, that'd be pretty significant. Okay, so I'm gonna go back here. [S] Three, two, one. [D] I think you nicked one. [S] I don't see nothing. [D] Oh, you hit it right here. You want to try one more time? [S] Let's go for it. [D] He's worried because he's about to go to homecoming, and this is his last opportunity. All right, ready? [S] Ready. [D] Three, two, one, fire. [gun shot] [S] I missed again. [D] Did you miss? All right, well, that was your shot. [S] Darn. [D] Enjoy your dance [S] Now I'm not going to. [D] Why? [S] I'll be thinking about this the whole time. What do you think you missed? [S] I felt it felt low. [D] That time felt low. All right, well, you can go on, and I'll try to hit it while you're gone, and I'll get it. [S] Okay. Do it for me, please. [D] Have fun. [S] Yes, sir. [D] Okay. Now that my son is gone, old age and debauchery will beat youth and skill. Move this thing a little closer, and we'll just do this. We'll play the angle game a little bit. We'll just move them in a little bit, huh? It's neat how that works. How did I miss? [Explosion sound] On plane, I'm going to aim lower than I think I need to. All right. Three, two, one. [gun shot] How on earth am I missing? [explosion in slow motion- deeper sound and longer duration] I could not figure this out. It didn't become clear what was going on until editing the video. And then if you roll it back and play it slow, you can kind of see it. Look close. The hammer falls, the percussion cap goes. But there's such a long lock time that I have time to move the gun off target, and then it fires. It's the lock time that's getting me. And maybe even the fact that the percussion cap is firing and I'm flinching. Something's going on. But that little bit of time is what's making me. My hand move off target. How?!? [gun shot] It worked! [Destin Laughing] That is so stressful! [explosion sound] All right, I hope you enjoyed that episode of Smarter Every Day. I mean, clearly, I was just having fun here. My son is learning a lot about firearms, and I want him to. I mean, he's doing good with safety and stuff, but I want him to have a better understanding of the fundamentals. Like a hands on. Not just a knowledge, but an understanding that this many grains of powder equals this kind of boom, that kind of thing. And all gunpowder is not the same, obviously, but this was fun. I really enjoyed this familiarization with this stuff. Obviously be careful if you do anything like this. I was firing these old antique firearms at a much reduced load from what was recommended, like half powder kind of stuff. So be safe. Yeah, I. I hope you enjoyed this. Big thanks to Ridge for sponsoring Smarter Every Day. I'm sitting here looking at this, trying to figure out how I shot. It looks like I was kind of like tilted like this kind of. Anyway, this is fun. It's fun to think about. I hope you enjoyed this episode of Smarter Every Day If you want a Ridge wallet, go to Ridge.com/Smarter I hope you enjoy that.

JJofuF2zcTE,Live Interview from the ISS Cupola - Smarter Every Day 303,,Educational,"Hey, it's me, Destin. Welcome back to Smarter Every Day. I'm very excited to share this video with you because it means a lot to me to see how it's all played out. Years ago, I met a guy named Don Pettit. Don is an astronaut, and he is an incredibly curious person, a childlike love for the unknown and discovery, and he's just an amazing guy to talk to. Well, Don and I have talked over the years and done some experiments together, and I've learned through the years that he is the mentor astronaut for a guy named Matthew Dominic. Now, the schedules have lined up so that Don Pettit and Matthew Dominic are in space at the same time. And that's special because it's not often that a mentor astronaut will fly with their mentee. So this little overlap in time is a very specific moment that I wanted to capture. And so I wanted to do an interview with them. Now, what's so special about this interview is Don and Matthew are both accomplished photographers, well respected for their ability to take incredible photos from space. And we're going to get to do an interview with them in the cupola. It's awesome. It's like we're in the cupola with them. We're squished in there and there's elbow room only. And so you feel like you're up in the cupola, and we get to see what it's like to take photos from space. And on top of that, you got their relationship, and you can tell that they're just so happy to be there. So this is a really special interview, and I hope you enjoy it. I'm really excited that at some moments in there, I was able to talk them in to letting the camera float around. That just adds to the weightlessness feel. I just love it. So all right, let's go to the space station, and let's talk to Don Pettit and Matthew Dominic, and learn how to take photos from space. Okay, we're about to connect to the space station. We're going to see Matthew and Don. We're going to see what's going on up in the cupola. [Mission Control] 10 seconds. Standby for that call. [Matt] We're ready for the event. How's it going, guys? Check, check. Going great. How do you hear us? Lima, Charlie. [Don] We hear you loud and clear, even through the vacuum of space. [Destin Chuckling] [D] That's quite the- [M] Loving life hanging out the couple with Don. Check it out the view. [D] That's quite the setup you have there. I just figured our delay out, so I'm going to have to be quiet after I say something. I am noticing that you've got really good exposure on what looks to be night going away. Is that correct? [M] Absolutely, yeah. Just a couple of minutes ago, one of my favorite things happened. The sun just rose up in front of us, and we went through dramatic lighting changes. We actually had the shutter over here in front of us on this side. We had closed, so we weren't burning our eyeballs out. Then just before you called, we were able to open it up as the sun went down on the other side of space station. Yeah, the dynamic lighting is pretty impressive. [D] I'm going to level with you. This is what's going on here. I saw the interview you did with Scientific American in the cupola, Matt. I thought it was incredible. I happen to know that you guys are actual real-life on-Earth friends. The fact that you are together in space and you're both astrophotographers, this is just the coolest thing, and you both look like kids in a candy store. Is it as cool to be there together as I hoped it would be for you? [Don] Yeah. Sometimes we have to focus on what the mission is and not what we would like to charge off and do. [M] It's been an absolute blast up here. We have our jobs that we do during the day that we're supposed to do, and we actually do do them. But going off and hopping into the cupola and taking pictures or learning a lot of stuff from Don. Before I launched, Don and I spent a lot of time in his backyard, and he was explaining some of the things you need to know, or I'd borrow a camera, and Don would show me a few things on the camera and give me a head start. It's awesome that just the way things worked out, Don's up here on the space station, and we're having a blast. [D] Just so everybody understands, it's my understanding that Don, you are Matthew's astronaut mentor, and so you had to teach him all the little astronaut things that little astronauts learn to do when they first learned to astronaut. [Destin breaks out laughing] [Don] We end up teaching each other because Matthew's got these amazing skills that he came in from his background, and we're like two stones that are rubbing the angular edges off as we go through life. It's a blast learning from Don. We both have the same giant curiosity about the world around us. We both have different backgrounds, but the same immense set of childhood curiosity about everything around us. [D] What I want to know... Yeah, go ahead, Don. [Don] Hold it, but childhood curiosity, some of us haven't even grown up yet. [D] It's an open secret in the whole NASA community that, Don, you've had a list that you've been writing to take up to station for a really, really long time. My question is, Matthew, have you gotten to see the list of the little experiments he's going to do in his off time? [M] Saturday morning science is going to be amazing. Don's got a lot of cool experiments lined up. I've seen just a glimpse, but I think the whole world is going to grow and learn from what he's going to do up here. [D] That's awesome. With your permission... Go ahead, Don. [Don] I was just going to say the best is yet to be. I think that has something to do with Shakespeare, but it also applies to orbit. [D] I'm excited for you guys. Okay, so here's the question. We're in a rare situation where we have two really good photographers in the cupola with a downlink, and you have video cameras there. My question is, do you have the ability to move the camera around the cupola on this little talkie-talk that we're doing here? Matt, I know Don might not be able to do this, but I know you probably figured it out, right? [Don] Yeah, Matt and I had a bet as to whether you were going to ask that, and I thought, No, Destin isn't going to ask that. [D] All right, so with your permission, I want to know, I want to explore the space of the cupola. This is something I've wanted to do my whole life. Don, in fact, I don't know that you remember, the day we met, you were in the mockup of the cupola in building nine. Do you remember that? [Don] I remember that, and yes, I do. What they do want to point out, the cupola is a pretty tiny, cramped place, and sometimes we've had up to six people in here, but looking at special events. But you need a real wide angle lens in order to gather the scope of what's going on here. The video camera we have, we've got a wide angle adapter on it, but it is not the same field of view that you can get on a standard mirrorless camera. [D] Got it. Do you have your Z9 handy? Do you guys have that thing and the wide angle? What wide angle lens are we talking about? [Don] Okay, we've got this lens is a zoom lens that we use for daytime imagery, and it's fairly slow. It's like a F-F-4-5. This is a 24-millimetre F 1.4 lens. We use this a lot for night time imagery. Here is one on a mount... Right here. [D] Oh, yeah. [Don] This is a 50 millimeter F1.2 lens. And It's not an ultra-wide angle lens. It's kinda considered a normal lens for this format of camera. But man, it really sucks in the light and allows us to do night time imagery. [D] Is that a remote shutter you have there? [M] Yeah, exactly. [Don] A cable release. [M] This is fun to handle a camera. One of the really cool parts I enjoy about using a camera up here is if I need another I just leave the microphone where it's at. I could just talk into the microphone. It's like it's like I have three hands. But Don and I have been really having a blast with this 50 millimeter lens. It's an F1.2, so it's really fast. Takes in a huge... It's just a giant light bucket, and we've been on different shifts. Don, every morning has been taking pictures of the comet, and then late at night, I've been taking pictures of the comet that we've had going on right now and streaming them down to Mission Control as well. So we've been having a blast doing that. [D] Okay, so what I want to do is I want to get a feel for the space. You have that wide angle on the Z9. You have the big boy on the Z9. Can you just flip? Can you turn the camera on and record video of this, of the Z9? Can you record Z9 video while we're talking? [M] We might be able to do something like that later, but the camera we have right now is the XF. We have a camcorder, an XF 705 on a downlink. It's hardwired into space station. We have a cable running back down into node three, we call it, and that goes into a coder. We're actually on a cable with the camera we're currently using. The Z9s are predominantly our steel cameras that we use, and we do have some cool 16 millimeter fish eye lenses. We have an 8 millimeter fish eye lens that we put on the Z9, but we have a little spinny wide angle attachment that we put on the camera we're currently on. It's actually fun. You can spin it off and you can see the perspective change real time there for the camera we're currently using. [D] Oh, that's awesome. Oh, yeah, that's it. That's really cool. [M] Yeah. See if you can... [Don] You hold the camera. [M] See if you can do a good spin, Don. It's fun to spin it off real nice. There we go. Now you can see this lens spinning off the front of the camera. We have a good time with the tools we have available. [D] Oh, that's great. That's awesome. So there's a few questions I had. When I saw your Scientific American interview, which was great, you were talking about these new filters. And so what I'm wondering, these filters on the window, most of the photos I've seen of space station, of the Earth, the ground has been blown out. But these filters allow you to be able to see you in the cupola and the Earth, correct? [Don] Yeah. I borrowed an idea that the big boys in Hollywood use when they do filming indoors with windows and brightly-lit scenes outside. You want them all balanced. The intensity is just too great to record with standard equipment. What the big boys do is they put neutral density filters as a thin film over the windows to balance the intensity between the outside and the inside. And that's what we've done here. I talk NASA into cutting some four stop ND filters to fit the cupola windows, and we can put em up. It takes a few minutes to put them up, but it allows video, balanced video, to be done in the cupola. It's really bright outside. And by cutting the intensity down four stops, four EV, that's a factor of, gosh, 16, right? [D] It's huge. [Don] It allows you to balance the internal video with the outside. For still cameras, you don't need that because you can put a flash on and you can pump enough light inside the cupola to balance with the sunlit outside. [M] Actually, I think we can quickly demonstrate it. Behind Don right now, we've got filters up over the windows, but we don't have filters on all the windows right now. And if I just turn the camera right here, that window and this window do not have filters on them. So you can see they get a lot brighter just by looking out those two windows. [D] I see, but you're using it to light your faces, which is pretty cool. [Don] One of the things that I try not to do, and that's to overexpose the whites. If you take the whites and blow out the top end of your detector, then there's no detail at all. You see that a lot in photography from orbit with the clouds being blown out. It's really good to at least keep some detail in the brightest part of the region in the clouds. [D] So your sensor is light sensitive and you have the darker colors and the lighter colors. You're saying you never want your histogram to hit the top. Is that what you're saying? You never want to saturate. Do I understand correctly? [Destin's echo in their speaker] <i>I understand correctly?</i> [Don] Yeah, and I would rather lose detail in the blacks in the low-end than the blow detail out in the whites. If you blow detail out in the whites, it's really noticeable. Your eyes tend to get drawn to the brightest region of an image. If there's no detail there and it's just snow, snow, white, that is not as esthetically pleasing to me as having some detail in the whites. Then the shadows are faded into oblivion, and we're used to seeing that. That's I prefer to balance the exposure across the range of lighting that's there. [D] So here's what I want to understand. I want to know, I saw a picture of you, Matt. You were taking a picture of the top of the cupola. It was a little video. When you shot the Kilimanjaro shot, you were looking out the big round porthole window up top. What I didn't understand is where were your feet and what were you holding? And were you just having to float there like your microphone? Because you have two hands that are on the camera and you're not anchored. So how are you doing that? [Destin laughing] [M] That's a great question. I can't show you that right now. We got folks down in that other module. But beneath us, there's little handrails and there's little footholds that you can put your feet on. Maybe this is a bit more a little bit more detail, but I actually have One of our Jack's a crew mates had Ninja socks, and I still have some of them on board. I have little Ninja socks I could grip things with and that are helpful. But we get to wear socks everywhere we go up here, no shoes, and I'm able to grip things. Or down beneath this or there's little crevices in the walls that you put your feet into. I was thinking about this just the other day. As I was floating around, I was grabbing something with my hands, and I've been up here long enough now that my feet just drift off and they just grab things. It's really interesting. I don't think about it anymore. My feet just grab things that they know where they are, and I use that to stabilize my taking pictures. [Don] Matthew is right. We would be more advanced as human beings if we had retained our prehensile feet. [D] You need a monkey tail. So you are using your feet below, and you're using the camera above. And how do you know how close... You're not touching the window, I noticed. So you just have an overall understanding of the length of your body, right? Can one of you grab a camera and the other one film how the other one does it? Can we do that? I'm not sure that you guys are capable of doing that, but if you think you are. [M] Sure. Sure. I think we've got the camera stabilized here. It'll say, Look, this is one of those moments, right? You see them holding the camera, the microphone floats or Don readjusted for me. But a lot of times the Earth is moving by so fast that we have to pick a pretty fast shutter speed, or you can also, if it's at night and you're trying to take a picture at night, you actually hand track the Earth as it goes by with the camera to reduce motion blur. It would look something like this. That's daytime right now, but I'll show you what a night shot would look like in the cupola. When you're doing that, you're actually stabilizing on the Earth by looking through the viewfinder. When you're looking through the viewfinder, you can see the Earth, and you look to keep the center crosshairs of the camera on the same spot of Earth to get rid of the motion blur from the Earth, the Earth rotating and or the fact that we're going 17, 500 miles an hour to get rid of that. A typical night shot with this new lens we have, we're shooting one over 300 or one over 320th of a second. But even that fast shutter speeds, you still see some motion blur on the Earth. We take some of that out by very steadily tracking the camera on the Earth. [D] So star trails on Earth, Don, when you shoot them, you're going to start to get a little streak in about four seconds, right? [Don] It depends on your lens. With this 50-millimetre lens, if you If you have an exposure greater than about a fourth of a second, you could see notable streakiness in the stars. If you want pinpoint stars, you got to have a shutter speed with a 50-millimetre lens greater than a fourth of a second. If you intentionally want star streaks, I like to use a 30-second exposure on that and then just do repetitive exposures and then assemble them as an overlay in Photoshop. [D] Are we talking about on Earth or on station? [M] Don is talking about on station. A quarter second on this lens, you're going to see star streaks. Then at a quarter second, because you have the Earth rotation involved, in addition to the space station, you see the city streaks. We really like to shoot cities at night in the 200s or 300s of a second to get rid of the orbital motion. But on Earth, depending on the lens, you can probably go, I can't remember, I haven't done in a while, but 10, 15 seconds Earth without having to worry about star streaks. It's a big difference. In fact, when I share a lot of... When I've shared a lot of pictures over the past couple of months, I typically write down, Hey, these are the camera settings. One of the most common questions I get is, Why are you shooting such a fast shutter speed? The realization of our orbital speed impacting that, people come to realize it's a lot. We shot a hurricane picture at one over 32,000ths of a second, and it turned out to be a great picture. [D] Your camera has been still too long. Can you just somewhere else. It's just the shots. I just need to see some movement. No, no, the video camera. Can you show me something else? I want to see the cupola. [M] Got you. I put it on a mount. To give you a sense of what's going on in our world and how tight a space we're in, Don and I are packed in the cupola right now, and I'm moving my feet around while I'm talking to you around somebody who's doing bench press beneath me. Somebody is on a bench press, and they just put their feet out on the bench, and I'm moving my feet around them as they maneuver We're doing what we would call weight lifting, but you were pulling against a vacuum. That's how tight a quarters we're in right now. [D] It's on ARED? Are we allowed to know who it is or is it their private time? [Don] Okay, here we go. You can see now how Earth is... The camera is adjusting to Earth, but then look at me, I'm in a shadow. If I go It's down like this, now I'm properly exposed because we have it on auto exposure. Then I come up here and you can see Earth is all washed out. But if you keep yourself within the confines of the neutral density filters we've put up, you can see that the camera is doing a pretty decent job at 4F stop reduction of balancing the intensity of the light both inside and out. [M] Let me do this. Is he still there? [D] Yeah, I'm still here. Can you show me the... Oh, that's a great shot. That looks awesome. Can you show me how the shutters work? Did we lose you? Yeah, can I see a closeup of the handle? Like that handle? Because one of the first conversations you and I had done was about that handle, and there's a seal there. [M] There you Yeah, Don is going to go ahead and open the handle of the top shutter, window 7, we call it. There's the crank. One of the first things I noticed when I came up here was this is a mechanical device opening a window or a shutter that just opens up the world to the vacuum of space. There's this through that little thing, through the mechanical seals that are in there, straight to the space. We're lucky enough just to get to sit in here and see that shot right there. Don, you're looking good. [D] You do look good, Don. [Don] Yeah, that's because I put on a clean shirt for this interview, Destin, just for you. [D] Oh, thanks, Don. I appreciate that. What am I looking at there? What spacecraft is that? [M] Here. Got you. All right, we'll give you the quick tour around the bend here. This is our Cignus spacecraft. This brings up so much cool cargo for us in science and payloads and food and Ice cream. In fact, this ice cream and the shirt that Don's wearing came up with this spacecraft. We reached out and grabbed that spacecraft with this robotic arm. It came, flew up, it hovered. The spacecraft was hovering right out here. That's actually the solar panel from Cygnus, and it was hovering right out here. We reached out with the arm and we grabbed it and then connected the space station right there. Don's ride up to the space station, that's the Soyuz right there. Soyuz docked our other crew, was out there on that other module on the Ume that undocked a couple of weeks ago, but Don's ride to space station is the Soyuz right there. I'm going to try not to make you sick and flip you around and look at Earth and then flip straightforward down to the front part of space station. And way out there on the front of space station as we're zipping around Earth is Dragon. That's crew nine. That's the crew that just arrived about a week ago. And on the top side that you can't see is crew 8. We can spin around and we can see some experiments out there on the Japanese module. And we can see radars and our solar panel is doing good work charging our and running our whole space station. I'm actually enjoying watching the camera adapt to each one of these settings here as it goes through. You can see how we point into the darkness inside the cupola and then Earth, and it just has to adjust really quick just how bright the Earth is. But this is one of the cool windows. There's not always a lot of structure out this window, and then flip around, and that gives you the full tour of the space that we have here on the out the window look from the Russian segment on the Aft part of space station up to the front of the space station. And then Don gets to sit right here and talk to you about it. [Don] The cupola is less than 6 feet in diameter. If I stretch my arms out, I can reach 6 feet, and I can more than reach the whole cross-sectional diameter of the cupola. It's a pretty tight space. [D] Don, question for you. How do you feel like a young astronaut, Padawan Matt, has done with the teaching that you gave him? What do you think about the shot he got, the high altitude event? [M] A picture of which picture? Did you say? The Sprite? [D] Yeah, the Sprite. That's what it was. Thank you. What do you think about Matt's picture of the Sprite? What do you think about Matt's picture of the Sprite? [Don] Oh, man, that was amazing to catch a Sprite on edge. You could see structure in the Sprite from space. The structure is commensurate to what people could see from Earth. What I want to do in terms of Sprite hunting is to get a nadir view straight down on a Sprite. So both Matthew and I have been shooting nadir with about a 200 millimeter telephoto lens to try to catch a straight down nadir view of a Sprite. We haven't caught one yet, but we've probably taken 50,000 pictures of the tops of dark clouds. But one of these times we're going to catch a nadir view of a Sprite. [M] It's going to be awesome. [D] To be clear, a nadir view is orthogonal to the surface of the Earth out of window seven there. Is that correct? [M] It would be right down that way. We've been shooting straight down out that window, and then I've been shooting out towards the front. We look at the map and we look at the weather for where we're going to be, and we're able to identify where there's going to be thunderstorms. We target thunderstorms that are right after sunset so that they have the most energy in them. You want to have all that energy from the sun during the day built up in the Earth, and that creates the most energetic thunderstorms, and we target those. Then we're just trying to shoot a lot to try and capture this event. You can either shoot by maybe setting up an intervalometer, but of the camera only half a second. We've been using the remote shutter. The remote shutter has a lock feature, and so you can fire off a shot that's every... If you're shooting maybe a 50th or a 60th of a second exposure, we can lock it down so we have five milliseconds in between. So you're just shooting. You'll crack out maybe 2,000 or 3,000 images in a short period of time. [D] Matt, you're about to leave, man. We've got just a little bit of time here before com loss, but my question for you is, this is the cupola. This has been your spot for six months now, your first time flown astronaut. What do you feel sitting in that room right there with that guy right beside you? What are you feeling right now, knowing you're about to go home? [M] So many feelings. I'm grateful. Don and I spent a lot of time before flight talking about things, and Don gave me lots of great advice from just how to fly in space, what the problems you're going to have or just about photography and what you need to do. And one of the things Don had me do before flight, and I took it on, was I would check out these cameras. NASAs is really nice. They let us check out the cameras, and I practiced a lot. So that paid off. So practice paid off up here. But things that I'm feeling are obviously grateful that Don showed me those ways of what to do and how to get there. And then I feel an immense sense of responsibility as well. I remember coming in, floating into the cupola for the first time six plus months ago and just looking outside and thinking that I had some responsibility to take as many pictures as possible to capture what my eyes have seen to share with the world. This is an insane view. I don't think I've got there yet. I think I got a lot of ways to go, but it's really hard. [Don] And what a mission to have to try to take as many pictures as you possibly can. [M] We've clogged up the downlink a little bit. The KU bandwidth we have, the satellite bandwidth, has limited by how many pictures we've taken up here trying to capture that. [D] When you get back, I'd like to just have a couple of your minutes to find out what your favorite picture was or one of them. But before we leave, I just want to say there's another Don that we should recognize, and that's your dad. Your dad has a long history of this stuff, right, Matt? Your dad's name is Donald, too, right? He sent me an email about the new lenses and stuff you got. Yeah. Yeah. [M] No, my dad was a photographer. He was a photographer in the US Air Force and then continued that career doing local production and direction. And so, Don Pettit has pointed out that I know a little bit about composition and setting up a photo. And I think a lot of that came from watching my dad set up photos and looking at some of the photos my dad did, some of that intuition about how to quickly pick up a camera, point and shoot to capture a moment. Sometimes up here, you just don't have a lot of time. I remember one time I was up here with Mike Barrett was shooting, and the moon looked just right. I ended up pulling out this 50 to 500, quickly throwing in a card, resetting the camera, and shooting the moon over Mike Barrett's shoulder in just a couple of seconds. I think that intuition for composition comes from a young age of doing it and watching my dad doing it. So thank you to my father for that one. [D] Dons are important. I just want to say I think we're about to lose comms, guys. Thank you so much for your time. I just wanted, if I'm honest, I wanted to capture video of you two in space together because I love it. And anybody that's ever interacted with you, knows how special this is. So thank you for your time. I really appreciate it. And Don, I'm looking forward to seeing all the things you do on orbit. [Don] Yeah, like I said, the best is yet to be. [D] I really want to know what that means, but I'm looking forward to it. [M] Thank you so much for the interview. I much appreciate it. [D] Thank you, gentlemen. I appreciate you. You're great, guys. Thank you, Mission Control. I'm grateful for your time. [Mission Control] Destin, that was fabulous. That was so much fun! All right. That was an awesome interview. It was a full circle moment for me having met Don in a mockup of the cupola and then getting to talk to him in the cupola. That was really, really cool. These guys are on social media. If you want to follow them and get their photos, I'll leave their handles down in the video description, just follow them, man. It's a really cool timeline cleanse for whatever's on your algorithm. You get to see really cool pictures from space, and they're interesting people. So go check that out. Also, you can follow NASA @NASAastronauts. That's really cool. I have a thing that I do that I think you might find interesting. It's called @WhoIsInSpace a guy named Jeff and I, we post all kinds of stuff from people that are in space at any moment in time. So I'll leave that handle down below as well. You can also check it out at whoisinspace.com. When Don went to the space station, that was a new record for how many people were in orbit around the Earth. 19. That was a big deal. So you could just go to whoisinspace.com and you could see everybody that's in space at any given moment, whether they're Russian or Chinese or European Space Agency, Canada, US, whatever. It's all up there at whoisinspace.com. I think you'll really enjoy that. One more thing. There's a Smarter Every Day thing I'd like to tell you about. It's a Patreon. I have a Patreon account. And basically what that is, it's like a goodwill engine. If you enjoy Smarter Every Day and you appreciate what I do and you see what I'm going for here and you're like, Man, I want Destin to be able to keep doing this and not have to worry about sponsors or anything like that. For people that like that and they want to pitch in, they go to Patreon.com/smartereveryday and they just kick in. I'm grateful to everybody that does that. But one of the cool things we do every year is there is a Smarter Every Day sticker team, where I thank people for sticking with me on Patreon. So the way that works is every year, I physically mail a sticker to your house if you are a supporter at Patreon.com/smartereveryday. So that was the Supersonic Baseball team. One year we had the James Webb Space Telescope space team, and last year we had the Exploration team. This year we're working on the sticker for the sticker team. And if you are a patron, you can suggest what the sticker team is this year. So there's a post on Patreon. Go check it out, and I will physically mail a sticker to your house. And the cool thing about it is it's like a little club, and you get it the year that you support. So if you've never done it before, this is a great year to jump in on the sticker team. It's going to be really fun. So thank you to everybody that supports on Patreon. I'm grateful. And yeah, I'm honored that you would spend time watching my videos. I put a lot of time into them, and I enjoy it. So I think that's everything. So feel free to subscribe to Smarter Every Day if you want to. If not, no big deal. I'm just grateful that you're here. That's it. I'm Destin. You're getting Smarter Every Day. Have a good one, bye.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sEK6wZWMbCY,Climbing Kilimanjaro - Smarter Every Day 302,,Educational,"Hey, it's me, Destin. Welcome back to Smarter Every Day. Years ago, my buddy, Brady Haran, made the coolest video I've ever watched on the internet, or one of them, where he boiled water at different altitudes on his way up to base camp for Mount Everest. I love it. Okay, the water is boiled now, and the boiled water temperature rates are 88. [soft piano music] I love it. You should totally go watch this video. But today we're in Tanzania, and this is the first part of the trail to go all the way up to the top of Mount Kilimanjaro. I asked Brady if I could replicate his video because I loved it. And he learned a few things along the way about using certain types of thermometers. And we're going to try to incorporate that stuff today. And a long time ago, I made a video about hypoxia. Nasa did an experiment where they put us in a chamber and we removed the oxygen from the tank. We simulated an altitude of 25,000 feet elevation, and I lost my mind, literally. And it had to do with something called hypoxia. And it's a fascinating thing that happens when you have lack of oxygen. So today on Smarter Every Day, we're going to boil water at different altitudes. And along the hike, we're going to see how the temperature of the water changes, and we're going to talk about that. But I think the water is almost boiling over here. Shedrack. Shedrack, right? [S] Yeah, Shedrack. You're very right. [D] Okay, this is my guide. He's the man. Are we boiling? [S] Yeah, we're still now boiling. [D] Okay, let's go see. So how many different places you think we're going to boil? We are going to boil the water like this in every camp. So this is our starting point. This is our beginning point. [D] What's our altitude here? This altitude is 8,170 feet. [D] 8,170 feet? Yeah. Where we are going is 9,127. [D] Tonight? Tonight, where we are going to sleep. [D] How high is the highest we're going to go? The highest we can go, and probably we're going to have time to boil the water like this, even if it will be difficult. But we will try to boil the water at Uhuru peak. [D] Which is 19,000. Okay, we're boiling. You ready? [S] Yeah. You're in Celsius. Oh, okay. This is Celsius, yeah. Yeah, I'll turn on the Celsius. All right, here we go. Celsius. 92... 92.7 on one. You're 92.7, I'm 92.6 [S] Okay. [D] Now you're a guide. You used to be a porter, right? [S] Yeah, I miss. I miss to be a porter, but sometimes I can carry even more about what I'm carrying right now. [D] Yeah. Was it fun being a porter? [S] Very fun, and actually, it's a very tough job. And for me, I think it's good. For those who want to become guides, it's good to start as a porter. So it will be like... It's a very good consideration for someone to start as a porter and become a guide. So at least you can know how it feels being a porter. [D] So you can relate to the team? [S] Yeah. [music continues in background] Boom. This is First Camp, and we are at the elevations of 9,200 feet, and now we have 91.8. [D] Yeah. Mine's 91.6, and you hit lock. [S] Yeah, the same. 91.6. Okay, no joke. Earthquake, right? [T] Yes. [D] We're in the rainforest right now. You can see all the vegetation, and the trees are big. [S] We are crossing the natural border between forest and heather zone. We are now entering the different ecological zone. [D] The heather zone is characterized by what? [S] The heather zone, actually this name is derived from the trees which dominated this area. I mean, those heather trees like Erika Borea and Philippia excelsia. That's why we call this area. [D] Are those Latin names that you're saying? [S] That is Latin names, yeah. [D] Okay. [S] You're correct. [light upbeat guitar music begins to play] [D] Asante. Mambu, Mambu. Coming up on 10,000 feet. 89.7 [S] 90.0 Very curious to see what the temperature will get at the summit. As you can see, we started with 92.6. Yesterday was 91.4, and now we have 90.0. As we're going higher, it seems like the temperature is going down very quickly. [D] All right, I think this is Kilimanjaro. Two days in, you finally get to see it. Altimeter says 11,500. [S] Which is very correct. [D] Is that close? [S] Very, very correct. Yeah, it's very correct. [D] 89.4. [S] Yeah, let us go with 89.4. [D] Okay. We were in the Heather yesterday. Today, we're in what's called the Moreland. But this feels like Utah or maybe, I don't know, parts of Arizona. So we're in the third region in terms of climate. [S] The correct number is 87.8. [D] 87.8, I got 87.3. [the porters begin clapping and singing an upbeat happy song] Mine's 86.9 [S] 87.4. [D] So this was 13.7? (13,700 FT) [the porters singing louder] [a call and response part of the song] Jeffrey. [J] Yeah. Let's go. Let's go. [D] Let's go. I wasn't fast enough with the camera, but Olaes is up there carrying my pack, the big pack. He was past me before I could even pull the camera out. Insane. [S] We are the Pofu camp. Actually, according to the elevation yesterday, now we lose like 500 feet down, and we still carry on with our measurement. If you tap this side of the mountain, first you have to cross the ash pit down to the Crater Camp, and then up again like 500 feet to the summit. [D] So we can't see Uhuru peak. [S] You can't see Uhuru peak from here. [D] Okay, but that's where we're going. [S] Yeah. [D] So where are we at right now? We're on the north side. [S] We are on the north side. [D] Okay. [S] Yeah. [D] Okay, the next zone that you walk through is the Alpine desert. This flower is everywhere. [guitar and percussion music begins to play in the background] [S] The elevation here is 13,000 feet, and we carry on with our temperature measurement. [D] Okay. It's a little bit different, yours was.. [S]  87.9 [D] and mine is at 87.5 Okay. I'm going to go also measure the pressure in the atmosphere. It could be that. That could be the difference. [S] It's different even than the one we had yesterday. [D] We were 100 foot higher. Yeah. Here we're lower... Here were lower and it went lower. It could be salt content in the water, too. If there's mineral content in the water. [S] The different in the water source. [D] I wonder if that- [S] It's a different water source. [D] That could matter. [S] Yeah. [D] Because if this comes from a different spring and it has different minerals in the water. [S] Exactly. And this actually coming from the ground. [D] Okay. That could be it. Every morning, they have to check our pulse Ox levels to make sure that our brain is getting enough oxygen. Ope, 90. I got to 90. All right. Currently 13,100 and ascending to 16,000 over the next 3 hours. We're seeing how our bodies handle altitude on this day because that's going to be a big indicator for summit day. We're moving up into thinner air and we'll see how we do. Epeta, what's our elevation? [E] We are 15. [D] 15,000? Okay, we're at 15, 700 tomorrow's summit day. What are we doing? [Loma] Right now, we are going to 16, which is our acclimatization. Then come back to the camp. You don't need to go further more than 16 because we have to keep energy for tomorrow. [D] Even if everybody's feeling okay, you recommend staying at 16. Don't go higher. [L] 16 is enough. [D] Okay. [L] 16, then we come back. Keep energy for tomorrow morning because we are going to use the same trail. [D] Yes, sir. [L] Yeah, that's it. Loma knows what's up. This is the briefing before Ascent. We're learning everything that we need to know. It's the trickiest day. You can see all the guides are lined up and they're taking turns, telling us what to expect. 85.7. You have 85.6? [S] Yeah. [D] You think we'll get to the 70s? [S] Yeah. [D] You think so? [S] Yeah. We have to test our oxygen. Whoa. 79.... Is that normal? [someone yelling from background] Turn the camera off! [D] Turn the camera off! [Laughter] that's it. That's it. Hold on. [Saji, the Guide] Try again. [D] Yeah. [Woman in background] Is your hand cold? [D] Yes, it is. [Destin takes a deep breathe] [Deep breaths] Eighty-six (02%), 94 (Heart rate), Saji! [S] Yes, 96. 91, 91. Write that one. Write that one! [S] Come on, man. [D] It's like walking in loose gravel at this point. [the mics begin to pickup the loud wind] Go ahead. 18,300. It's kind of like a scramble. Climbing some rocks. You kind have to take a step and stop and breathe because there's not a lot of oxygen up here. I wonder what the partial pressure is of O2 we're at 18,355, about a thousand away from summit. There's Master, beautiful man on the mountain. I would like to introduce you to a killer step. This right here takes all of your oxygen. Then you have to stand there and you breathe. Then there's another one. All right, man. Yeah, that's good. That's good. The mustache, mustache. Yeah. Yeah, it's good. Beautiful. Yeah. Yeah. It's good. The mustache. You get it? Oh, mustache. It's good. Very good. Beautiful. That looks good. We're ready. [S] Push to the top, push to the summit it's getting hard now. Just now crossing 19,000 feet. Head's throbbing. Heart rate's pretty high. Just got to keep moving. [background music begins to build] Final push it's last 80 feet. [S] Good job. Good job [D] Thank you, buddy. You made it happen that's the sign. Thank you, Okay, we're at the peak, altitude 19,341. I see the gas cylinder. Canini is building a shield. Think we can do it? [S] Oh, yes sir. [D] I can't believe this is happening. We're about to boil water on the peak of Kilimanjaro. [S] Mine is 81.2. [D] Mine's 81.0. [S] Yeah, we did it. [D] We have the data. [S] We did it. [D] Thank you, sir. [the sound of wind rushing] Okay, before I show you the descent down the mountain, which is a whole other thing, and there's special rescue hardware they have and stuff like that. I want to talk a little bit about things that I didn't put in the video here because it's fascinating. I've got some bullet points here. The first thing I want to say is climbing Kilimanjaro is dangerous. There's a handful of people that die every year doing this, and there's a large percentage of people that don't make it to the top. So this isn't just something you do. This is a once in a lifetime thing for me and my wife. And this is just a really big deal. And so you don't want to do this unless you're prepared. We worked out a lot. I tried to limit the amount of oxygen intake during my workouts to try to stress my cardiovascular system. We also went to altitude to try to see how our bodies would react to over 14,000 feet. Altitude sickness affects different people in different ways. And so you need to know what your body is going to do. And so we tried to prepare for that as much as possible. Another note I have here is there's a moment at 17,500 feet that happened to us that was incredible. We looked up and we could feel our hearts pounding We saw two guides rushing a man down the mountain. They were clearly saving him. It was a rescue situation. He had an oxygen mask on, and it was an eerie moment because we were like, Oh, my goodness, this is the real deal. We are not playing around. At that moment, the porters, who were just so amazing, they started singing. They were calming us down. Inside, we were all freaking out. Wondering if that was going to happen to us. But they were managing our mental state and helping us chill out and just focus on the next few steps. It was amazing. I would love to point you to a podcast that I recorded that explains more of that. I'll tell you more about that in a minute. Another thing about how we did this, we hung out at around 13,000 feet for several days. We took what's called the Northern Circuit route. That's one of the most conservative routes. If we had not been with Killy Warriors expeditions, with these specific guides, I'm not so sure I would have made it because they limited you. They always say, Pole, pole, or slowly, slowly. Pole, pole. Pole, Pole. Pole, Pole. Pole, Pole. They would limit you with how fast you could walk so that you don't outrun your cardiovascular capabilities. In fact, on the acclimatization hike, acclimatization hike, on that one day to 16,000 feet, I got out in front of the group and I was going too fast. And my heart rate ran away, and it took a really long time for me to get that back down. So the guides really know what they're doing. They go far slower than you think you should, but they know exactly what they're doing. I was leaving for approximately, what, two minutes? Probably. And I was a moron. My pace was too fast and our heart rate shot up. And then Loma said, No, right? Loma said, Pole, pole. It takes discipline that I don't have. Thermometer calibration. Do you remember when Shedrack said, Oh, I think we're going to get down to the '70s, and at the top we didn't? Well, calibration is an issue. I boiled water here in Alabama, which is around 700 feet altitude, and I got above 100 degrees celsius. So Shedrack might have been right. The water might actually have been in the '70s. A really cool thing happened when we were on the mountain. Nasa astronaut, Matthew Dominic, who's really good at taking photos, was in the cupola of the International Space Station the day before we summited and he took these photos of Kilimanjaro. It is awesome knowing that that little spot of Earth sticking up above the clouds, we're on that mountain. That was incredible. There's a couple of pieces of internet that I think you should consider checking out. The first one is that podcast episode episode I mentioned. It's a podcast I do with my buddy Matt Whitman. It's called No Dumb Questions. And there's a particular episode called Songs of Ascent. We talk about the porters and all the things that they did to make this happen. It's really interesting, and I think you'll like it. The other one is the videos that Brady Haran made. The first video was the whole idea here. Brady, when I asked permission to make this video, he said, Look, I don't own the idea of boiling water at altitude. And I was like, Well, you do to me. Because 10 years ago, I watched a video that Brady made made, and it moved me. And I've been thinking about it forever. It was an intelligent, really beautiful piece of art and science mixed together, and it's what I want internet videos to be. It was gorgeous. And to follow it up, Professor Polyakov at Nottingham University explained everything about the experiment, including some things that Brady could have done differently. Now, videos like this don't just happen, especially in today's environment. The sensationalism reigns, and algorithmic pressure is applied to creators all the time. And I understand that you want to get more views and more listens so that you can get more money for advertising. And that's not good for the Internet, I don't think. I want intelligent, respectful content to have a place in the market. Brady figured out how to do that. He partnered with academia to make those videos, but that's rare, and it's very difficult to figure out. This video is not sponsored by a traditional sponsor. It's supported by something new. There's something called the Independent Media Initiative, and they've given an award to Smarter Every Day. And the only thing they've asked for in return is for me to ask you to be thoughtful about the next piece of content you consume after this video. And I think that's really cool because a video is going to pop up after this. Something's going to be there for you to click. And the question is, should you watch it? That's what they're trying to do. When I was younger, I would watch PBS. I would watch Mr. Rogers's Neighborhood, which was funded by both public money and private donations. And it was amazing. But TV is not a monolithic thing like it used to be. So what IMI is trying to do is they're trying to connect large institutions and foundations and even private donors with creators who are making intelligent, respectful content for the Internet. So what ends up happening is IMI ends up being this hub for people that are making thoughtful content. So if you want to check out what they're doing, go to the website, which I'll leave a link down in the video description, and just look at what they're trying to do, because they're trying to do something very important. They're kicking against the algorithmic pressure that creates sensational content on the Internet, and they're trying to make a future with more thoughtful content, and I'm excited about that. Thank you, IMI, for supporting this video. Thank you for considering checking out IMI. I'm excited about what they're doing. They're a nonprofit, and they're working hard to make thoughtful content for the future, which I'm very excited about. So now it's time to go down the mountain. All right, we're leaving. [upbeat plucky guitar music begins] Thank you, Shedrake. [S] You're welcome. [D] You're an impressive man. [S] You're welcome. [D] And your team is the best. [S] It's my pleasure. We are very happy because all of you guys make this trip. [D] It's because of Killy warrior. [S] It's because of Killy Warrior. [D] You have a good outfit. [S] We have a very good team behind us. [D] People like Boaz. Are you relieved? [S] Yeah. [D] I appreciate your leadership. Highest altitude you can be rescued with a helicopter. Here's the stretcher. 15,000 feet. It's pretty far up there. She bumped me on purpose? So these are little carts that are used to save people when they're hurt. Of course, you got a stretcher here. But I was expecting to see this all over the mountain, but I didn't. But they're pretty cool. They have shocks on them. That's pretty neat. It's incredible. So I'm not filming as much on the way down, and they're asking paparazzi why he's not being paparazzi. It's because everybody gets hurt on the way downhill, and I don't want to get hurt. What do you feel? [T] I feel very happy that we summited, and I feel very happy that we are now back at the camp for the day. However... 12 hours hours of exertion, and I have no clue how I'm going to climb out of this bed tomorrow. [D] It's not like a little exertion. It's like all you can do, like limited literally by your cardiovascular system. [T] No, because also it's limited by your knees. Your knees on the way down? Yeah. That was a pretty epic journey. It's a great thing to have done. Yes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
frbLIoqDIO8,How Disc Golf Discs Are Made (MVP Manufacturing Tour) - Smarter Every Day 301,,Educational,"We're finally doing it. A lot of people have been reaching out for a long time asking me to do videos about disc golf. So today we're doing a video about disc golf. And this is great because disc golf is right at the center of a lot of things I love. You've got aerodynamics and physics and all that kind of stuff. You've also got just spending time outdoors with your friends doing fun stuff. And then today, the special thing we're going to talk about is manufacturing, how you actually manufacture a disc golf disc. So obviously the aerodynamics of the disc are important because when you drive from the tee box, you want to throw it as far as possible and as close to the basket as you can. But also the mechanical interaction of the disc with the chains on the basket, that's important, too, because you want the putter to fall down in the basket. Chad and Brad Richardson from MVP Disc Sports up in Michigan, they reached out and said, Hey, we love what you do on Smarter Every Day, and we want to sponsor a video or a series of videos on disc golf for Smarter Every Day. So today I'm extremely excited because MVP Disc Sports does this special overmold on their discs. And a lot of people in the disc golf community think that's really cool for multiple reasons we'll talk about later. But that is an interesting process, and we're going to learn about it as a part of the overall Smarter Every Day manufacturing series. We've learned about metal stamping, roboforming, some really cool processes used to create films, and this video is going to roll into that. We're going to learn a ton of stuff about injection molding, about robotics, about how to design a plant for efficiency. So let's go get Smarter Every Day in Marlette, Michigan, and let's learn how MVP Disc Sports manufactures disc golf discs. [Intro guitar music riffs] I flew up to the Detroit airport, which is always exciting.   It's SO good. I drove 90 minutes north of the airport. Summers in Michigan are absolutely beautiful. I pulled into a large manufacturing facility. This is the headquarters and factory for MVP disc Sports. No photos or videos allowed. This is going to be difficult. I was led in by Shelly, and then we passed a putting green that employees used on breaks, and I was led through the headquarters and met Brad and Chad, the two brothers I told you about who started MVP back in 2009. These are people that had a vision. They started small and they started building things up, and they're using the talent pool from all over the Detroit area that traditionally works with automotive engineering and manufacturing. They're all pulling together, and it's been a huge thing for the local community. New manufacturing jobs in rural America using new technologies. I would love to see this model replicated across all of America. I was a senior high school. You were just starting college. Just starting college. It was just more of like a hobby. It was like college during the week. Then we would go home and pack orders, stamp this. Yeah, Brad and I did this, us two, for what? Five years before we got our first employee, four or five? Yeah, four or five years doing everything. Just doing a grind in the barn. [D] Slinging disc. [C] They always say it's the biggest sport you've never heard of is the phrase we use. It's out there. There's 12,000 courses worldwide, and we sell a lot of disc. [D] In disc golf, you throw the disc and it goes into a chain basket. And your thought was, if I could rubberize the outside perimeter, that the chain basket would grab the disc. [C] We were playing one summer, and it had a traditional disc and I had a large rubber band. I don't know why. I stretched that rubber band around the perimeter just for that grippy edge and putting with the target. The idea would be, oh, maybe that could help catch into the target better with the friction. We We figured, well, we can try making that. And so we did. That's what the first run ion is. [D] The intention wasn't to have a gyroscopic effect. It was to grab- [C] Increase the friction. That's where the idea started. [D] It started with the rubberized outside, but then you found your way into the gyro. [C] Just because those were too light and we said, Hey, we need to make it heavier, found the weight fillers, and we had to make a choice, put it in the center on the overmold, and that's when it clicked. [B] Year number 2 was we made a mid-range disc, which was more focused on the gyro technology. [C] If you throw a disc with no rotation, it just flips end over end. Ultimately, it's a gyroscopic aerofoil. That's really what it is. You break it down in its simplest terms. If you increase that angular momentum, you're increasing the stability. [D] If I had to guess, I would say you've done a lot of research into how dense you can make that outer ring. [C] That's our job, pushing those limits to increase that. We're never stopping that. That is our entire goal, increase that MOI. Of course, other things like increasing the grip and durability, other things players look for, of course [D]  Okay, there's two main ways that they make discs here at MVP. So we'll put that right here so we can see the difference. Okay, so this is a heavier plastic, this red stuff here. This is a lighter weight plastic, right? [C] Yep. [D] And this is a solid mold, a solo mold, you call it? [C] Yeah, a solo mold. [D] So whether it's a solo mold or an overmold, the manufacturing process is pretty similar. So what we're going to do is we have this roadmap here, and we're going to go through all the steps required to make a disc golf disc. And we need to give ourselves permission to jump around along the way because we're going to take some tangents. But let's dive in and start at looking at the materials that go into the process. So this is the... [B] This is the manufacturing warehouse. Okay. So this is essentially where the raw plastics come in. Most of our plastics are made in America, which is great. There are some European grades as well, but the vast majority of it is American-made plastics. [D] Got it. [B] Clear plastic granules here. [D] It's rubbery. When I When I squeeze it, I can feel that it's giving away, like it's pliable. Then is that a vacuum? [B] Yeah, vacuum line here. [D] Where's it going? [B] It goes to the drying system. [D] You have all this built. You built this with this in mind. [C] You want to automate your material handling. [D] This is like those Coke machines, the fountain drinks, and you've got all the material here, and it feeds up, goes to your dryer, and then gets fed in to your- [B] Plastic drying. That's a very crucial step prior to the next building. At least for this particular polyurethane it's very hygroscopic. Hygroscopic, meaning it absorbed moisture from the air. For the injection molding process, that's bad. You want to remove the moisture. [D] Step one, we get it from the shipper or from the supplier. [B] Plastic has moisture. It just naturally absorbs moisture. [D] Step two, we have to dry it. [B] Yes. [D] Okay. [B] Very important. [C] Those lines coming from the gaylord, those have plastic in them. [D] Yep. [B] Those feed the plastic to the dryer system. [D] What? [C] And they go here. [D] Did you design this? [C] We work with a company that helps us fit it to our specs. [D] Is it all stainless steel? [C] Aluminum, but the elbows are stainless steel. [D] Okay. [C] The elbows have to be a tougher material because as that material makes that turn, there's a lot of friction. So as you see, they come down individual. [B] Well, you could see all the different grades of plastic granules inside each little hopper here. [C] The temperature and time at which you dry is important. [D] What is this? [C] This is our resin selection station. We can change these hoses, which changes which machine, which plastic goes to. Instead of having... Basically, this is a central system. [D] This looks like a network patch panel. [C] Yeah. [D] It looks like you're taking Cat 5. [B] Yeah. [D] What's moving? [B] Similar. [D] What's moving? [C] So you can hear material. Which one is it? [B] That's probably going to the drying hopper. [C] I can't see which one. [D] I can't see. Okay. [C] So the key is it allows us to switch which material. So for For example, we have a soft version or a firm version, we can switch it and it goes in the machine automatically. Much easier than trying to redo a bunch of lines. [D] Okay, yeah. Wow. What a neat part. That's a manifold. You're bringing the material in, here. [C] It comes over and into these first, and then it goes out the bottom here into this to the machine. [B] These pipes here. [D] Oh, and then it goes to the machine. [C] This is right before it goes to the machine. [D] Okay, got it. [C] Based on how much we're consuming at any given time, how much of that material is being used, if we raise this, it will increase its dry time because it starts from the top, and as it's taken away from the bottom, gives you how much time it's exposed to the dryer. So that is our time. [D] It's almost like a grain bin. [B] Exactly. [D] It's a grain bin. So on the grain bin video, we talked about you put the beans in there, you blow from the bottom. Are you blowing air? [C] There's hot air right there. [B] So right here? [D] Yeah. That's air? [C] That's going into... It's just like a grain bin. Exactly like it. [B] Starts right over here. This system here. [C] So that's a dryer. [B] It's blowing the hot air through each system. [D] And it's going back to it. So it's a closed loop. [C] Yes. [D] Got it. [B] See that level sensor? That level sensor is our demand. So as a machine consumes plastic, if it gets below that level sensor, it will fire that demand to bring more material. [D] So where's the master controller for this whole [B] Right over here. [D] Whole setup? I love how they both know the whole system. [B] That's the master controller right there. Press one, loader one, press one, loader two. There's a different device that I use press 15, loader one. Dominic is MVP's process expert on injection molding. He's going to show us where that material first starts to be melted. When you put the TPU beads in here, are you heating it up or is this a screw auger type heating method? [DOM] This is a reciprocating screw. [D] Friction. [DOM] Yes, friction, shear heat. Now, we have barrel heat on this, but most of the heat that melts the plastic is created by the screw pushing the plastic into the barrel itself. These heaters on there are just to maintain that minimum level of heat. Things like your screw RPMs, your back pressure, how fast you're filling, those are all going to affect your sheer heat of the plastic and the temperature of your melt. [D] Chad took me over to another machine to show me the screw outside of the machine. This is very similar to the thing I saw at Kodak. [C] Yes. Yeah, they have a much smaller scale than the one at Kodak. Yeah. [D] So plastic pellets go here. It turns this way. [DOM] It turns this way and it feeds the plastic forward. And as it moves forward up the screw, the diameter between the flights increases. That pushes the plastic pellets against the walls of the barrel, and that's where that friction kicks in and melts our pellets. [C] This right here is a smaller diameter compared to out here. [D] I see. [C] That's where your shear is happening. [D] But is the outside of the helix the same diameter? [C] Outside of the outer is the same, and that fits in this diameter here. 50 millimeter. [D] 50 millimeter? [C] Yeah. [D] All right, so plastic goes in there, which feeds into about right here. It's turning. As it's turning, it's pushing the plastic forward. That shear and mixing creates a melting. Is this heated as well? [DOM] No, the screw is not heated, just the barrel. [D] Okay, the barrel is heated. So the process is called injection molding. That implies that this auger is injecting the plastic into a mold. And we're about to see one of those molds for the first time, and they're really cool. And the cool thing about the product today, you remember we were talking about the core mold that they make, and then they put the overmold on the outside. Well, the product they're running today is glow in the dark, which is awesome. Look at it. You see which one has the overmold on which means the raw materials have to be glow in the dark. Isn't that cool? Let's go make some discs. [C] So these machines are core machines. We'll get to one that's running. So the core, again, is the center portion. [D] So this is the injection mold, right? [B] Yep. [D] The mold itself is a large piece of metal. You have two faces, and we have this picker here that it's a Cartesian-type thing. So we have a cavity in there, and we're injecting plastic, right? [B] Correct. [D] Okay. And how long does it take for the plastic to flow in? [DOM] On this process, just over five seconds for the plastic to fill the cavity. After that, there's about 30 seconds worth of cooling in the mold. That will set the plastic up enough for it to be able to demold and for the heart picker to grab it. [D] Are you flowing water through the metal part of the mold to cool it down? [DOM] Yes, we are. [D] Okay. Is it chilled water or just room temperature water? [DOM] It is chilled water for this application. If you look on the bottom, we have two water circuits on each half. Cool water goes in and the warmer water comes out. We regulate the flow on that, so we have a turbulent flow. [D] Better. Heat exchange, just like a rocket nozzle. [DOM] Exactly. This is the rare case where laminar flow is not as awesome as turbulent flow. [DOM] Exactly. [D] I concede this. Now we're going to talk to Sean. Sean's got a mold, and he's to break it apart and show us the inside. Wow. [S] They're a little bit heavy, but... [D] So this is an insert mold. So the insert would go there. [S] And the plastic would inject throughout here. [D] On the sides. [S] It comes in. Whatever profile we put in, it fills in from the side here, get our perimeter. Then when it's done, it opens up, and these pins push the disc out. [D] Sean took me over to see what they call the flight plates. These are the actual inserts that go into that larger mold assembly. Oh, wow. These are all your inserts? [S] These are all of our overmold inserts. So some halves match up with other numbers, but most of the time, it's just an A-side and a B-side. So you'll get the top flight plate. Where you get the plastic coming in. And then you'll have a bottom flight plate, which where your ejectors come out. [D] Wow. [S] And like I was saying, this profile is usually out here a little bit, so you never see those ejectors. [D] Chad gave me access to his 3D CAD files for the overmold so I could animate what's going on with the injection molding process. The plastic pellets are fed from the hopper down into the screw, which uses friction and shear to melt the plastic. Now, remember, this is a reciprocating screw, which means it has the ability to retract and push the molten and plastic forward. Notice this yellow check ring is moving. On the backstroke, the auger turns and loads the syringe, so so to speak, by pushing plastic through the holes that are under the check ring. When the screw moves forward, however, the checkering moves back and it closes off the holes and the plastic is injected into the mold under extremely high pressure. Inside the mold, there's what's called a hot manifold, and a manifold is a pipe that branches into other pipes. The plastic in this manifold stays liquid because it's electrically heated. Let's remove that liquid so we can see how the plastic is flowing into the mold. When the screw pushes forward, it pushes the plastic into the manifold, and then it splits and flows to both sides of the mold cavity as it fills it. The air in that cavity escapes through specially-cut vents that are in the mold. Water is flowing through the mold body on the backside of the plates, drawing out the heat and solidifying the part. The amount of time it takes the part to cool down and solidify is called the dwell time. The mold opens and the ejector pins then kick out the disc. So this next part does a lot. We're going to take the cores and we're going to go all the way through the over-molding process and it involves robots, and it's amazing because Chad designed these robot cells that just move the discs all the way through the process. There's lasers, you're going to love this part. [C] This is protected with light curtains, floor as well as the walls. This is where the operator can load up stacks of cores. You can see different ones. It runs through one, two, three, four, then rotates. That way we can shuffle our colors. In this case, they're all uniform, but a lot of times, if it's not glow in the dark to all of our traditional colors, they're all different colors. Before this cell, someone's job was to shuffle all the colors. There you go. [D] What's it doing there? [C] It's rotate. This is so we can go one, two, three, four. Rotating. So we can shuffle eight colors. [D] Wow, that's neat. And you just keep it shuffling the whole time. So the robot is going to come grab a disc. That's a pretty wild end effector there. Oh, yeah. Did you design the end effector? [C] I did not. I partnered with- [D] Did it spray something on there? [C] The discs want to suction cup together. There was a small pneumatic cylinder that is knocking the disc below it in case it was suction cup. It doesn't always suction cup, but it just fires no matter what. [D] That looks like something you added on afterwards because you had a problem. [C] It absolutely was. [D] Okay, that makes sense. All right. [C] Now, after it picked it up, you can get a better angle here. It goes through that jig. [D] It looks like you're setting it in there and you're indexing for a position. [C] Correct, yup. [D] It indexes in such a way where it always knows where the center of the disc is. [C] Yeah. And with our different diameters, we have offsets on our control panel that we can select to accommodate the different diameters where those offsets are. [D] So it's waiting on the last one to shoot. It's going to go take out the shot, and it's going to put another one in. So it's unloading and loading at the same time. So you don't eject until the robot is in position. [C] Yes. It wants to be a catch. [D] After we come out of the protected area here, so we're going to... This is the overmold. [C] This is your... [D] Your sprue? [C] Where it's coming from your sprue to a runner to your gate where it's interfacing with the cavity. And then also our added trim groove feature, which is not traditional. [D] So we got to trim that thing off. [C] Yeah. So this makes a cutting condition. Oh, this is our transfer jig for the collaborative robot to pick up from. [D] What do you call this machine? [C] This is our flash trimmer. It trim that outer perimeter, trimming the gates as well as that feature we put on there, that groove. I call it flash trimmer, but it's more of a groove cutter. [D] Is that a razor blade? [C] Yeah, that is a ceramic blade. We move the blade up and down to extend the life. [D] Oh, I see. You actually move it vertically. [C] Yeah. [D] Oh, and you have just a little micrometer adjustment here. [C] You can see we have a vacuum cup that lifts that part up. We lift that up so we don't have to make a double entry with that robot. The robot can go in, drop, lift up, and grab it all in one entry. We tried to make it so you can remove and then come back. It's all one entry. Drop, pick. [D] This is a... Proximity sensor is everywhere. [C] Yep. Part detection is key for automation. Robots are blind, so you got to tell it where the parts are at any given time. [D] Part detection. [C] In this case, this transfer stand, so it's going to wait at the end of a cycle. It's looking for that proc sensor to be triggered when that part falls. That cobot's waiting, and it's going to meet it. That little wiggle is an intentional... Get things to settle, because every once in a while... See, this interface is gravity fed. Well, the problem is when it locates on those two pegs, our two runners sometimes can be index a little funny, where it can intercept the end of arm on the cobot. So we do a little bit of that wiggle motion to make sure it settles in between those grippers. [D] I saw it actually rotated a little bit. [C] And that lines it up here for the trimmer as well. [D] This is probably the most pleasing part of the process. [C] Yeah. All the hard work feels good when you see it move. [D] All right. And obviously, all of this-Yup. [C] Yeah, you could pull it up. [D] This is going to go to regrind. [C] We make our two disc out of it. [D] You make what? [C] Recycled. Our recycled line is called R2. [B] R2 Neutron is the recycled process. Any waste material that comes out of here, we felt it was better to make a product out of it than have to send it to the landfill. It's part of our mission of sustainability of being able to use everything. [D] You call this a Cobot? [C] Yeah, Cobot, collaborative robot. These have opened up a lot of doors. The main advantage is you don't have to have any guarding. Now, I say any guarding. You have to be careful on how you use these. Everyone thinks you can buy them just zip them around everywhere. There's a speed limit and also a height limit. You can't go above shoulder. You don't want to be in your neck and eye area. [B] That's what this is for. [D] Is this an OSHA thing? [C] Yes, this is an OSHA thing. But in general, what this is, every axis on this has a force sensing. So if it were to bump into you or get you pinched, it will stop and won't cause bodily harm. [B] That's what's different about this yellow one here. [D] The yellow one will just eat you up. [C] This will be bad. [B] It's like getting hit by a car. [C] You could see our sign on the window to give you an idea. Velociraptor containment. [D] That's why there's not a case. If I were to bump that, it would stop. [C] After trimming, it's going to swing over to that laser. [D] What does the laser do? [C] That laser, underneath the laser, is a scale. That scale is communicating with our controller, and that controller is communicating with the laser, and it's going to mark the weight in grams on the disc. [D] Oh, it's burning. It's burning it on So it actually uses a laser to burn that on. These have changed. So are you feeding colors into? [C] Yes, with our feeder on the other side of the machine? [D] Yeah. [C] Here's our color. Here's our color master. [D] You do the colors? Yeah, I do the programming of the recipes on the color feeders. We're using this color feeder right now to try to make a nice swirly overmold on all of the parts. These you feed in. [D] Where are you programming this at? The program all gets run in right here. We could do it on a PC well and then transfer it onto here. But this, most of the time, we'll just build the recipes in here. Normally, when you're running through your color program, you want to just follow the rainbow. All the colors next to each other in the rainbow, they all get along very well. So as long as you start with your reds and work your way through. [D] That makes me want to see the Wall of Shame where you made a bunch of dumpy colors. It does happen. The colors that don't get along when they mix together look awesome when they're side by side. [D] I see. So like a red and green, you don't want to mix. But if you can get red and green next to each other without mixing, it looks phenomenal. [D] So they're complementary colors. Exactly. [D] They're across from each other on the color wheel. [C] There's two different feeders. There's auger style or cylinder. This is actually a full cylinder rotating. [D] So it's not much at all. No, it takes very little. [D] So it goes into this Plinko style merge machine. [C] There's some magnets there to capture any metal, ferrous material. Sometimes you get metal shavings. [D] Goes in there. [C] And then a vacuum. This is a line vac. It's a Venturi vacuum that goes through. [D] And that goes all the way up here and feeds into the funnel. So now that we have the disc made, it's time to put the art on the disc. Now, this is a thing because it's how the athlete emotionally connects with the disc. For example, I went putting the other day. I knew the gyropalooza was going to do what I wanted to do, and I got to call it the gyropalooza. That's a festival they do. Anyway, the art is a thing, and people love the art on their disc golf discs. So we met up with Manuel, who showed us how to put a single color graphic on a disc. So this is just a normal disc. And then what is this stuff right here? [M] This is your foil. So that's going to put the LabSecond print on there. So it varies in colors that you can do foils. But for this, you want to just do black. And the safety here, so you can't just do it one-handed, so you can't get anything injuring you. So you just do two here. Comes down, take it out, make sure it's good and looks really good. [D] Oh, it's advancing. Yeah. Is it heat? [M] Yeah, it's heat. Temp right here, just on the side here. [D] Yeah? [M] So I mean, that is blistering hot. You're talking probably two or three degree burns if you're touching that bare-handed. [D] Oh, wow. That's cool. Yeah. So now that you know how a single image is put on a disc, you can imagine in your mind how you might put a image like this with multiple foil colors on it at the same time. They created this machine that's proprietary. They don't want me to show it to you because they want to keep that a trade secret. But they can put all kinds of images on discs, and they can vary all the different colors of foil. So one of the things that Brad and Chad kept talking about is they really like the idea of having multi-colored discs with multiple colors of foil on it. So you can almost infinitely vary the possibilities of what an MVP disc might look like. And that's through all the different color combinations. So at this point, you have a beautiful disc that could be any number of colors, and it's got a really cool design on it that's got a varied colored pattern. So they put them in boxes, they wrap them up with this really cool plastic wrap palette machine, and then it goes to the warehouse where it's being prepared for shipping. And oh my goodness, do they have a huge warehouse. Look at this. It's incredible. They have all different kinds of things here. They were even testing on a new storage system when I was there that'll let them store 20% more inventory. Regardless, they ship this stuff out to retailers all over the world. In a second, I'm going to show you something amazing. But right now, I want to tell you about the second channel video because there are parts of the process I didn't show you in this video, and I think you'd be really interested in them. For example, how they recycle the pieces of plastic they don't use. They have this really interesting process that they go through. I find it to be hilarious. You're going to have to see my reaction to that over on the second channel, but it's amazing. They regrind this stuff. They're even trying to recycle the dust, which is awesome. That video also goes into the quality control of the plastic and how they measure these things geometrically to make sure that they have the correct leading edge. It's fascinating. So be looking for that video over on the second channel. But for now, I interacted with Brian, who's the guy that programs the robots, and I asked Brad and Chad, Hey, can I just have some of Brian's time? Because I want to put a camera on the robots so I can see this process from the robot perspective, and the results are fascinating. [Plucky guitar music begins] (Song is ""Empousai"" by Gordon McGladdery) [Valve clicks and hisses turning vacuum grippers on and off]  [Robot arm servo sounds 🦾⚙️] [Metallic sound from knockout pins] [Air hissing] [End effector knocking as it inserts other disc into mold] [Fast moving servo sounds 🦾⚙️⚙️]  [𝅘𝅥𝅮𝅘𝅥𝅮 Music sounds like a video game 𝅘𝅥𝅮𝅘𝅥𝅮]  <Faster servo sounds  🦾⚙️⚙️⚙️> <Hissing air in distance> [(Just enjoy this next part visually) I thought that was awesome, but what I'm about to show you might be even awesomer. They're awesomer? Yeah, awesomer. There's a thing that happened in the disc golf world that was a MOMENT. This thing happened, and it changed MVP Disc Sports' business forever. And I really think it's fun to watch Brad and Chad tell the story because you can tell they genuinely get excited. Check this out. [B] We like to have that extra capacity, the ability to ramp up quickly because disc golf can have those moments, those explosive moments, where you got to ramp up really quickly. An example that we went through in 2021, James Conrad shout out, hit the greatest shot in disc golf history. It was the final hole of the World Championship. [C] You'll have to put the clip in your video. [B] You definitely got to get the clip in. [D] Okay, tell me about it. What happened? Paul McBeth and James Conrad were neck and neck on day five of the World Championship's five-day event, and he was behind by one stroke. On this particular hole, he was in a situation where he had to make a shot 250 feet out to tie. And he just had to make it. Everybody knew, based on the circumstances, he had to make it. He ran it, and he just absolutely nailed it from 250 feet away. [D] Really...? [B] He tied the round, and then he went on to the playoff hole, and then he won that particular hole, won the World Championships. [Announcer] He's got a lot of space out there to the left. We'll see how aggressive of an angle he puts on this, or if he keeps it more neutral and just lets the disc drag over. He's using that Envy again so..., it's a putter [Crowd is silent.. nervous murmuring] <Lady yelling far away.> Get the hole! [Crowd getting louder...] [Screaming now... Building...] 🥏[⛓️CHAINS⛓️] [CROWD FREAKS OUT!!!] [Announcer in disbelief] OOOOooohhhhhh...NO WAY. NO WAY [GROWN MEN SHRIEKING] [YOUR SPEAKERS ARE RAILED, IT'S JUST NOISE] [YOU WANT TO HUG SOMEONE AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHY] [It's not stopping....] [They're probably still screaming in that field] [B] So when that moment happened, we had to ramp up super quickly to meet that demand. That's actually why we bought these seven machines in this section here, because we just needed to ramp up as quickly as possible. [C] That one shot in his world championship was this of machines right there. [D] What?  Like.. why?...People just started loving disc golf because of that? [B] Well, it's just such a memorable moment in disc golf that there was just the demand for that particular product in that particular era. [D] OH, he hit it with one of your discs... [B] (Humbly) Yes... [C] He just recently switched to our brand, and it was his first year playing with us, and he wins World in a spectacular way. [Announcer] You're a world champion,  James Conrad... [Crowd Cheering] CON - RAD!   CON - RAD! [D] That footage is from the Professional Disc Golf Association. YES, there is a professional disc golf association, and they have this sweet logo that I love. It's from a documentary they did called ""The Holy Shot"". It's a fun watch. You might want to check it out. When I showed my mom that shot, it blew her mind. A 250-foot putt, and just the energy of the moment, it's very exciting, and I loved it. I want to say thank you to MVP disc Sports for inviting me up to check out the manufacturing process. I thought it was amazing, and I hope you enjoyed this video. We're going We just have to do more videos with MVP. We just have to figure out what the topic is going to be. So thank you to MVP, Brad and Chad, for sponsoring this episode of Smarter Every Day. There's no call to action. They didn't say, Hey, go to this website, buy these discs. They just want you to love disc golf as much as they do. And I hope you go check it out. I hope you go get a disc. It doesn't matter if you buy it, borrow it, whatever, and go out and do a walk with your friends out in nature and do some physical activity. You're on these screens enough, right? Just go to the park. You probably have a disc golf course near you. Go find it. Call a buddy, go out, and make a friend in real life. I think it's great, and you should do that. So that's the call to action. Thank you, MVP Disc Sports, for sponsoring this. And If you have ideas for what the next videos that we do with MVP should be, let me know. Because, yeah, write a comment.

q0aFOxT6TNw,iPhone 17 Pro Review: Paradox in a Box!,,Tech & Business,"- The best thing about the iPhone Air is actually how much it seems to have freed Apple up to make the Pro phones even more pro. (slow dramatic techno music) (slow dramatic techno music continues) (slow dramatic techno music fading) Have you noticed that? These new Pro phones are thicker than last year, more room inside for bigger batteries, and a vapor chamber, and a bigger camera. It's not quite on the level of the Ultra phones, but this is the most maximalist that an iPhone has ever felt, and I like it. But also, let me let you in on a little not-so-secret secret. The Pro phone is always the best selling one. Like this year, the iPhone Air is the most interesting and it's getting the most YouTube clicks and the most views, but then the Base 17 is more than ever the one that most people should get and the best deal. But it turns out the Pro Max, specifically, by far, is the most popular, by sales numbers. I was gonna try to find a way to show you guys this, you know, channel sponsor Dbrand, they make a accessory for every single model of iPhone, and so their sales distributions kind of match Apple's. And this is the distribution this year. Over half our Pro Maxes, and between the two Pros, that's like 90% of orders. So yeah, it's fun to watch Apple kind of walk this line between being a more pro phone than ever before and this maximalist new design and everything they're doing, but also, being literally the most mainstream phone of all-time. Like the cameras. Might as well start there, right? The cameras are the most pro thing about the Pro iPhone every year. And on one hand, no professional would say, ""Oh yeah, thank gosh I have eight lenses now in my smartphone,"" like Apple seems to want us to believe. It clearly has three. But, the three cameras you get are more evenly matched than ever. The primary and ultra-wide are essentially unchanged from last year, but the telephoto gets a big update. It's now also a 48-megapixel camera and it's a 4X telephoto lens. Last year was a 5X but only 12-megapixels. So, this new one feels like a more natural, portrait focal length. It's roughly a hundred millimeter equivalent and all of your zoom shots will have much more detail and much less noise, thanks to the sensor being much larger and much higher resolution. Now, I will give them credit for the specific 2X zoom increments, because while they are not actually new lenses, they do specifically process each of the images shot in a 2X crop to be slightly sharper and better looking than just a pure digital crop on the middle of the sensor. So, you know, it's not the level of a pure optical zoom, but it's better than nothing. So, I don't know why they only do it at these focal lengths, honestly. Either way, it's a really nice total package now. Three matching 48-megapixel cameras, all of which are super reliable, just as good for casual shooters as they are for people who depend on their iPhone for work, or maybe who happen to have an entire YouTube channel about cars that they happen to shoot all on smartphones. (clears throat) Yeah. Electric G Wagon review coming to ""Auto Focus"", shot on iPhone 17 Pro very soon. I do still kind of find myself wishing they made some other improvements, like the point light problem at night when you shoot in the dark and those little flares always show up. They haven't fixed that at all. Or even adding 8K video support. There's a two terabyte iPhone model now. I feel like 8K video is just a flip of a switch away, but not this year. But you know, the changes are stacked up nicely over the years from older Pro phones like the 13 Pro and the 14 Pro. It's not a huge difference versus last year, but it's nice. Also, what you're watching right now is ProRes raw footage from the iPhone 17 Pro, which I was particularly excited about because that means I can go into the new Final Cut Pro 11.2, I think it is, and I can literally change ISO and white balance after I shoot, which is very useful. Also, the file sizes are huge. And there's even another Pro feature that they added that they couldn't brand for themselves because pros already use it and named it, and that's genlock support, which basically lets devices talk to each other so that they can stay in sync over large, multi-device shoots. Pretty sick. And also the selfie cameras are more pro than ever more about that in the 17 Base review. But yeah, a lot going on with cameras. So let's be real, 95% of people who get these phones are just gonna point and shoot and these are more capable and reliable than ever for that. If you want more in-depth stuff on shooting like professionally with this camera, you can check out Tyler Stalman's review, which I'll link below. It's really in-depth and he shot the whole thing also on the iPhone. My favorite thing about this new Pro iPhone though is actually the new design. It's not often that the newest iPhones actually change a lot and get thicker and heavier, but like I said, I think that's kind of one of the best things about them coming out with a separate phone that's designed just to be super thin, so that if you want a thin phone, go get the Air. But if you don't care about that, if that's not one of your priorities, then here's the new Pro, which goes the other direction and isn't afraid of a few extra fractions of an inch. And I love that it's an all uni-body metal jacket now. This is not a glass sandwich anymore. Literally, the whole body of the phone is metal now with glass cutouts at the back for wireless charging, and then at the top for those millimeter wave antenna. This makes it more durable, it makes more room inside for a bigger battery, which we'll get to in a second, and there's enough room for a vapor chamber for the first time ever in an iPhone. And then the new plateau at the top, I actually think it's great. This is where I've been putting my index finger on Android phones for years. It's like a natural resting spot to hold up the phone. Same thing with this one now. And Corning's Ceramic Shield too, in case you haven't already heard, is also clearly awesome for preventing scratches to the front glass. A couple of nitpicks though, no black color Pro phone? You sickos. This is like one of those weird things that it feels like Apple's doing just spite me, where they're making a bunch of products that should have a black version but don't. Like the new MacBook Airs come in silver, and starlight, and sky blue, and dark blue. But no black? And then the AirPods Max refresh also comes in a bunch of colors, and dark blue, but no black. We need a dark neutral, especially because the color that you pick actually shows up around the front bezel of the phone. So you see the color you pick all the time. It makes the orange and silver that much more annoying to me. (sighs) I told you it was a nitpick. But then you've probably also already seen the chatter about Scratchgate, which is just how easily it seems like the anodization layer on top of the aluminum seems to scratch off and then reveal the raw silver aluminum underneath it. And I kind of don't really know what to make of this yet. I feel like this has come up before with a lot of darker anodized aluminum phones. And as a person who rocks the phone with no case, I haven't had any issues with the one I'm using. I've been tossing it around. But the JerryRigEverything test has revealed that the weakest part that you could get scratched or dinged is gonna be around the tightest corner radii, like around the camera plateau. So we'll see how many phones this ends up affecting. But we gotta talk about the insides of this phone because the redesign is one thing, but there's even more going on under the surface. The A19 Pro chip, shocker, is pretty great. It's benchmarked around 20% faster than the last generation and when paired with iOS 26 and 12 gigs of RAM now, these phones feel really quick and snappy, which is great. But the extra thickness has also made room for a vapor chamber for the first time, and it's actually made a real difference to the thermals and the behavior of this phone. Big shout out to HGX Studio, YouTuber, who is able to put thermal cameras on these phones under load and really visualize this, but especially compared to the Air, these phones rarely got any more than slightly warm to the touch for me. And as a result, they were able to actually hold higher frame rates longer while gaming and keep the display brightness higher when recording videos for a long time. Check out the rest of his video too, by the way. It's freaking incredibly well done. But, it also reminded me about why, in the Android world, like gaming phones kind of have the same effect. The stuff that makes a gaming phone really good, like better speakers and better performance, and better screen and big batteries, well, all that stuff is awesome for regular use too. And it's the same deal for the Pro iPhone. The stuff that makes a really good Pro iPhone, like the improved display, and the much better cameras, and the thicker, better build with improved cooling for shooting videos longer, and better sustained performance, yeah, it turns out the masses buying iPhone 17 Pro Max also really enjoy nicer screens, cameras, and batteries too. Not a surprise. And we've all been saying for years, ""Hey, just make a thicker phone and put more battery in it."" I just really feel like this is another place where having an iPhone Air focusing on getting super thin, let them feel free to go the total other direction with the other phones because if they're gonna claim the iPhone Air is all-day battery life, then great, every single other phone in the lineup gets even thicker with bigger batteries. So the 17 Pro has a 20% bigger battery than last year, and the Pro Max actually cracks the 5,000 milliamp hour mark for the first time ever, which is great in iPhone land, and also 40 watt charging now. So that's half battery in 20 minutes. To Apple, that's a big deal. We welcome a 20% year-over-year improvement. Now in Android land, obviously it's, it kind of looks like nothing, like it's nowhere near the Ultra phones with 6,000 milliamp hour silicon carbon batteries and 100-watt charging and all that. But, for a phone that ships in the volume that the iPhone does, very happy to see that sort of improvement when last year's phone already had really good battery. The iPhone is also very efficient. So I am getting a nice five plus hours of screen on time every day on not even the bigger phone, and it's lasting all day with 30+ percent left. So, I'm loving it. And then, there's just all sorts of other little things too, like with this screen, I think this is the first generation of iPhone that's had a toggle for PWM dimming. Now it's buried in the accessibility settings, but you can search and find it, and that is very welcome to many people. And there's also a slightly noticeable but better-than-nothing anti-reflective coating. But more importantly, the display gets slightly brighter now and I noticed that. It's up to 3000 nits peak. And satellite connectivity has expanded to cover messaging and location sharing too now, which is useful. So at the end of the day, the paradox is that making the Pro iPhones more pro is actually better for the masses. And this is the best one yet, it's the most freed one yet. And I think, you know, when they eventually, if they make some iPhone Ultra at some point, I'll probably still want all of that over this. But for now, this is good stuff. Now if you are thinking about getting an iPhone 17 but you are concerned about those scratches, then channel sponsor Dbrand does have some options for you. Like this Grip Case, which I have here in that black. And it also does a pretty good job of hiding that plateau, which if you've seen Zach's durability test, it is the most vulnerable spot for the anodization to chip off. Alternatively, if you're more of a clear case person, you can grab one of their Ghost Cases instead, which comes with a lifetime zero yellowing guarantee and also a full camera protection. Fun fact, these are also available at Best Buy in the US now too. Both cases check all the boxes you want in an iPhone case, like strong MagSafe and camera control buttons. But most importantly, they're both super protective. And then whichever way you go, if you wanna round out your protection with a screen protector, you can also pick up one of Dbrand's Prism Protectors. They're super easy to install. And if you bundle it with either a Grip Case or a Ghost Case, you can use code M-K-B-H-D at checkout to save 42% on the Prism. Pretty sweet deal. I'll leave a link down below for you to check 'em all out. Thanks for watching. Catch you guys very soon, still in Techtember, in the next one. Peace.

tDARtYjUiHs,iPhone Air Review: Beauty is Pain,,Tech & Business,"- Every product design (ethereal music) is a series of trade-offs. It's like a slider, where you can push it either towards form or towards function and it can be exciting when you push it way towards form. (moves into magnificent music) This is the iPhone Air. So Apple decided to make a ridiculously thin iPhone, yes. It's thinner than a number two pencil, thinner than any previous iPhone that's ever been made, including the one that bent. It's thinner than the freaking iPod Touch. That is ridiculous. And this isn't simply an iPhone shrunken down, Apple has done a ton of rearranging parts and pieces inside the phone. They've squeezed a lot of the compute and memory and logic board up into the top of the phone and allowed a bit of a bulge, which they're calling a plateau, which leaves most of the slimmer bottom of the phone for just battery. The edges are nice and softly rounded, and the whole outside frame is shiny titanium, which picks up a ton of fingerprints but also is remarkably durable. They 3D printed the USB type-C port to fit and all of the buttons and camera control, as thin as they are, go pretty much right up to the front and back edges of the phone. The end result is an iPhone that is noticeably thinner and lighter than it's been in a long time. It is super impressive, and importantly, deserving of the Air name. But it's not perfect. (chuckles) Of course, it's not perfect. You wouldn't be watching this review if it was that easy. There are a bunch of trade offs to making it this thin. It doesn't just get this thin magically without a bunch of sacrifices. Beauty is pain after all. And so now that I've been using this phone for a couple of weeks, I'm just gonna give you each of the trade offs that Apple made and how much you'll actually notice them. And I have some small concerns, some medium concerns, and then the big concerns. So small concern number one is they did remove the bottom speaker to achieve this. So most of the bottom of this phone is battery, but then those grills at the bottom of the Air are just for microphones. So the only speaker in this whole phone is up in that earpiece at the top. Couple things. A speaker that small is not going to get as loud, but there's also way less bass. So things are a bit tinny. But the worst case scenario is actually when you turn your phone landscape to watch a video or game or do something with stereo audio, in which case you'll probably notice all of the audio is coming from one side of the phone. And if you accidentally block that earpiece with your thumb, that's even more annoying. So the speakers are definitely not great, but they're acceptable for most everyday use. At least they're not horrible, you kind of just get used to it. So then the iPhone Air is eSIM only globally. This is, again, in an effort to make enough room for the battery, they're just getting rid of the slot where you normally have a little plastic SIM card. So this is a very direct trade off to get more battery out of that safe space. Apple won't say exactly how much battery they gained back, but some of the numbers I'm starting to see pop up around the eSIM versus non-eSIM iPhones, looks like there's around 200 milliamp hours of extra battery they're getting out of this. And believe me, I'll talk more about battery in a minute. But yeah, lots of people use regular SIM cards to this day. And I guess it's a bigger deal to me, because I swap phones a lot and there's lots of phones, from like Huawei and OPPO that I wouldn't be able to get my SIM card into and doesn't work well with eSIM, so I really dislike it. But I suppose for the average person, they'll only notice this once or twice. Once when they switch the phone, and then once when they move on to another phone. But speaking of carriers, the iPhone Air, unlike the rest of the iPhone 17s, does not support mmWave 5G. And the thing is, most people outside of the U.S. have never used mmWave 5G, and most people in the U.S. have also never used mmWave 5G. So you know it's super convenient once in a while. When you have it, you know, I found myself near a hotspot with a supporting device and if I happen to have something to download in that moment, it's great. But that is so rare and so far between that you might as well not worry about it yet. The modem in the iPhone Air is brand new. It's the new C1X chip and alongside Apple's new in-house designed N1 chip, which does all the networking, Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6 and Thread, it's performed great. It does not seem to have any weaknesses in speed or coverage versus Qualcomm iPhones, previous iPhones with other modems, so that's been great to see. But then the USB-C port at the bottom of the Air is only USB2 transfer speeds. So, that's just dumb. But now let's get to the medium concerns. First of all, less cooling. Okay, so I did notice this phone getting hotter. It's running the more powerful A19 Pro chip with one less GPU core than the Pro phones, but it's a Pro chip and the Pro phones are way thicker and they're made of aluminum for better thermal conductivity and they have a new vapor chamber to draw heat away from that chip and dissipate it through the body. The Air has none of that. And so I did have a few instances, especially early on, where I was doing a lot of the sustained activity and the back of the phone was heating up a lot in my hands, especially like right below the camera plateau. No question, it's gotta be throttling down that chip with any sort of heavy, sustained use, it's a little concerning, but the phone never actually did overheat or give me an overheating message. So I guess that is a good thing. So then there is the single camera, and I'm putting this in medium concerns, but it really very much depends on the person. For some it's just like, ""Are you cool with this or not?"" Because a lot of people, a lot of people, are currently using iPhones that have more than one camera. Lots of older iPhones even have that useful Ultra Wide. And most of the people thinking about buying this Air have those second cameras, even third cameras. And so the Air doesn't have an Ultra Wide, and I can't tell you how many times I went to go take a picture of something and then realized I can't switch to the Ultra Wide. And there's also obviously no zoom as well. I will say Apple makes a big deal about their processing pipeline for the 2x crops on the Fusion camera. So the middle 12 megapixels for a 2x photo having a decent quality shot, but that still doesn't replace having an actual quality zoom camera. And that's especially noticeable when you try to zoom in, I'd say anywhere past about 5x, the quality really starts to drop off in all shooting scenarios. All that said, (shutter clicking) the one camera you do get is really good. It's essentially the same as the base iPhone 17, and in the world of a thousand dollars phones, it is right up there with the best. The selfie camera too, which I'll talk more about in the base iPhone 17 review, genuinely innovative and dramatically better than previous iPhones. I think casual photo and video takers will actually mostly be fine with this single camera solution in a vacuum, but we're not in a vacuum and there are other options out and you just have to know that there are other phones that cost a thousand dollars that have way more capable camera systems that can do zoom, that can do ultra wide, that can do macros. This won't do that. So for me, someone who relies on the cameras on the phone a lot, this is one of the reasons I'm not going to be switching to or dailying the Air, but for your parents or someone you know who takes most of their photos and videos on the main camera all the time anyway, they'll probably be totally fine with this, and this was a carefully considered cut from Apple to get there. But now my two main concerns with the iPhone Air, and probably for most people, the durability and the battery, and some of this is actually kind of shocking. It turns out the iPhone Air is not just a survivor of the famous JerryRigEverything bend test. It's literally one of the most impressively durable smartphones of all time. I'm not exaggerating, it's kind of ridiculous. I think in most people's concerns, when seeing a piece of hardware this thin, naturally they're thinking, ""Oh, am I gonna break this?"" ""Am I gonna snap it in half?"" And the answer it turns out pretty definitively is no, this is not any less durable than a normal smartphone. The titanium frame can withstand more bending than any human can put their mortal hands through, and it'll snap back to flat even if you do get it to flex. And you can almost undoubtedly sit on the phone for an extended period of time, like an insane person, and it will survive. It's still IP68 water and dust resistant, dunk it underwater if you want to. And the Ceramic Shield 2 on the front and back is actually even more scratch resistant than previous versions. I know they say that a lot. ""Oh this one's the most scratch resistant yet,"" but it's to the point where it didn't even show the normal scratches at level six with deeper grooves at level seven on Zach's famous test, it passed even beyond normal smartphones. Now of course, glass is glass and glass still breaks. You could still drop this phone and shatter the front or back glass, of course. But you know, I think we all went into this thinking that the durability would be a major weakness of this phone and it turns out it's one of the biggest strengths, which is crazy. Turns out those engineers and material science people over there are actually pretty good at what they're doing. Or maybe they had some incentive to not repeat a certain past incident. And then it also turns around and gets a 7 outta 10 from iFixit for repairability and still retains dual entry when you go in to repair it, so you can take just the front glass or just the back glass off and Apple posted all their disassembly guides on day one. Kudos. So I guess I shouldn't be surprised that through all my throwing it in a frizzy bag and tossing it on a chair next to me, and all the abuse I've put this phone through, it hasn't even come close to breaking or bending. So that brings us to the last main concern, battery. So the battery on the iPhone Air is pretty weak and there's no getting around that. Remember earlier this year though, when I said one of the big pillars of 2025 smartphones was going to be these new, higher-density silicon carbon batteries? Well it turns out two of the biggest phone manufacturers out there, Samsung and Apple, well, they just didn't wanna take the dive on that quite yet on any of their phones. So not only is this phone thinner than ever, with less room inside for battery than ever, but it's also not even a special, high-density battery to make up for it. So the result is this big, bright, gorgeous six and a half inch, 120 hertz OLED display being powered by a battery the same size as the one in the iPhone 11. I will say parts have gotten more efficient, right? So like the display can throttle down all the way to one hertz and the A19 Pro chip can underclock super well. So it's not a disaster, but I'm giving the battery about a C minus. Ending the day with like 15% left in Low-Power Mode in normal use with four hours of screen on time for a brand new phone is not that great. Makes me concerned for how this will look in three or four years down the road. It's actually kind of similar to the camera situation. Like, there are lots of people who are now, today, it might be you, using a phone with a big battery that was awesome when you first got it. But now years later, if you're getting to the end of the day and it's dying and you realize you need a battery upgrade, the Air is probably not the phone you should be getting. But if you are getting to year three or four of your phone and the battery is not an issue and you feel like you're a pretty light user, then the Air could be fine for you. So to be specific, for my own use, like standby time I noticed was pretty good, like it is on so many other iPhones, but this Pro chip can spike up pretty quickly. So even with like some screen off stuff like wireless CarPlay for example, it would take big chunks outta my battery. Anytime the phone was doing anything heavy, battery beware. And then this phone also charges slower than the rest of the 17 lineup, which makes it even more annoying. So if you're a heavy user like me, well, you literally just end up keeping it on a wireless charger as much as possible. It's annoying, it was just very annoying to be honest. And that's sort of the two things that made it a deal breaker for me is the cameras and the battery. The difference though between those is the battery, you can kind of work around it, the camera, kind of can't. Also pretty classic Apple move to make the problem and then sell you the solution. So this is the MagSafe battery they launched alongside the Air. It's sold separately for a hundred bucks, and it's also just to be honest, not a very good accessory. It turns out it's basically the exact same battery that's in the iPhone Air, (graphics pop) but only charges it to about 65%, because of the heat loss during wireless charging. Not a great deal. So originally I said there were basically two ways to look at the iPhone Air. One is it's just Apple trying something new, throwing it out the wall to see if it sticks. Oh, maybe people like this or it is a long, premeditated preview at the future of all smartphones when they're all this thin. But I lied. There's actually a third way to look at this phone, and that is as one half of the upcoming foldable iPhone that we all expect as early as next year. Because it's easy to be impressed by the thinness of the iPhone Air, but if you've paid attention to the rest of the smartphone world lately, each half of a good folding phone is often even thinner than this iPhone. It's obviously a huge priority for them, because they're trying to get to the same thickness as a normal phone when closed, so double their typical Z axis. So all of this work, all of this incredible reorganization of the inside of the phone and the components and the miniaturization of parts and the efficiency maxing with their in-house developed parts like N1 chip and C1X, all of that effort is absolutely geared towards seeing if they can make the first ever, truly new form factor of an iPhone, maybe since the 10, one that folds in half. And it just so happens to enable this really thin form factor Air phone that they'll make in the meantime. Kind of the exact same way we got a Galaxy S25 Edge and then a few months later got the Z Fold 7, which was an ultra-thin foldable from Samsung. So I'm very much looking forward to that crazy foldable iPhone when it comes, and what they'll call it, and what software it'll run and all that other stuff. But for now, this one, yeah, it's an iPhone still. You know, every year we get the new iOS and all of its features and the clear theme and visual intelligence and all the iPhone stuff. And I review that separately and you guys already know about all that stuff. And then we get the new iPhones announcement, and there are almost zero new actual features here other than the selfie camera. But now it's like I'm reviewing, you know, the box that iOS comes in, you know? And I think this package, as cool as it is, like, this will speak to plenty of people. It's beautiful, it's super trim, it's super light in the hand, which is underrated. People are gonna pick this phone up and immediately love it. But I think maybe the best thing about the iPhone Air is actually how much it seems to have freed Apple up to make the Pro phones even more pro, which are now thicker and have more battery and heavier and bigger cameras and all unibody metal now. That's the one I'll be daily driving. Stay tuned for the full review, of course, on the Pro phones next. But hey, if you are planning on picking up an iPhone Air or literally any other iPhone or any Android phone for that matter, then channel sponsor Ridge has it covered. And I know Apple made their MagSafe wireless charger, but trust me, you'd rather have Ridge's wireless charger. Because this power bank is 10,000 milliamp hours. So that's good for about three full charges. Plus, it can actually do other things so it can charge your Apple Watch. It has two built in cables, USB type-C at 20 watts and Lightning for any legacy Apple devices. And it even has a kickstand built in to pop up your phone and watch videos while you're charging. It comes in Matte Black, Matte Olive, or Basecamp Orange to match your style. So whether you're upgrading to the iPhone Air or literally grabbed any other new phone that Ridge power bank has you covered. So check it out today at ridge.com/mkbhd for 10% off. Thanks for watching. Catch you guys to the next one. Peace.

7gtc1DW2Tgo,Wait... Smart Glasses are Suddenly Good?,,Tech & Business,"(intriguing music) - All right, so I'm in the middle of reviewing these new iPhones, which are pretty interesting, but you know, they're new iPhones so they're iterative. And then Meta of course decides to also have an event 'cause it's Techtember and things just don't stop. So I put that down for a second. I fly back out to California, and what Meta has to show me is actually shockingly advanced. Because just 10 months ago, I saw this, I made a whole video about it. These are Meta's Orion AR glasses prototypes, which were super cool and overlaid software onto the world around you. But they can never sell these things because the materials alone cost like 10 grand, and they're a bit too cumbersome, and they have a whole separate stick with a computer in it that's nearby, and they overheat, and the battery lasts like an hour. It was a cool proof of concept of a bleeding-edge technology but not a real product. Now here we are 10 months later, and they're handing me a finished product with a price tag and a release date. And it's these, the Meta Ray-Ban Display, clever name, I know, but it's essentially an updated version of the Meta Ray-Bans, and it's massively better than the Orion prototype. Now the main difference with these is these are a monocular display, meaning it's only showing up in one eye, the right eye, and it's fixed slightly lower and to the right of the middle of your vision, but it's still full color, plenty sharp, 42 pixels per degree to be exact, and more than bright enough to be seen outdoors. I tried these things outdoors, gets up to 5,000 nits. So it's like a real-life little HUD in the corner of your vision that you can turn on or off at any time, and you still control everything through a neural band on your wrist that uses surface EMG technology to read the electrical impulses going through your arm as you make different gestures that you pretty quickly memorize and can draw discreetly and quietly with pretty good accuracy. You can scroll up, scroll down, select, you can go forward and backward, and even turn up and down volume by pinching in the air and twisting slowly. And as I'm getting to try these, I just keep thinking, ""The rate of improvement is kind of insane."" For example, the light leak you might remember from Orion was very evident. Like you could see clearly when someone was looking at something when they were activated with the Orion glasses. Now when I pull something up on the display in these, it's basically invisible to the outside world. The light leak is nearly completely gone. Now of course this is a much smaller field of view, but it's pretty impressive that from most angles there is virtually no way to see that I'm looking at something on the screen in these glasses. Even with the perfect angles, when the light hits just right, all you can really tell is that these glasses do have a waveguide in them and I seem to be looking off to the side a little bit and not directly at you, and that's it. And for the neural band, the controls have gotten even more refined and precise. So back when I tried it 10 months ago, it was pretty good. But you know, the idea of doing text input by just drawing letters in midair with your hand was just an idea. Now it's an actual feature, and it's maybe the most reliable, quickest method of text input that I've tried with these. It's absolutely insane. I was writing whole sentences first try, quickly, with no errors. It was nuts. There's also no separate computer puck necessary for these, like there was with the prototype. Everything is self-contained in the glasses, which are admittedly definitely kind of thick, you know, a little less crazy than the Orions, but you can still tell there's some stuff going on with these if I walk by wearing them. And they weigh 69 grams. Nice. So just as a non-glasses wearer, they are a little bit heavy, like they're just heavy enough to not forget that I'm wearing them, but they're not super cumbersome in my opinion. And of course you cannot underestimate how much aesthetics matter if you're gonna be wearing this computer on your face. Like there needs to be some element of ""fashion."" And I think they look better in person than they do on camera. And there's also two colors, either black or sand, and they actually come with a matching-colored neural band, black or sand as well. Oh, and the charging case. The charging case is also pure genius. It can either hold the glasses inside or you take them out and it folds down flat in like two seconds and still has enough room for four more charges of battery. This did not get enough attention for how awesome it was, because it came in the middle of a keynote that was kind of an absolute disaster in so many other ways. But I'm impressed with the charging case. Now here's the thing, these Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses have been out for like four years now and they have been a hit actually. They let you talk to Meta's AI and send messages with your voice and listen to music. But I'm fairly confident that the number-one use of these by far is to use the built-in cameras to record POV videos. So the real question you might be asking is, ""All right, Marques, what does adding a display into the glasses actually get you?"" And I was thinking the same thing. I'm glad you asked, because I have the answers now. So number one, first and foremost, you can obviously see the UI of the glasses instead of just relying entirely on voice commands. So if you wanna do something in the UI with the gestures and never speak a word out loud, that's advantage number one to having a screen. Number two is you can actually see the viewfinder of the camera now, so you can be very sure of exactly what you're capturing and you can review pictures and videos after you've taken them. That's also pretty useful. Number three, messaging and even video calls on your glasses are pretty sick. So if you're in a video call, you can see the person you're talking to and the person on the other end just sees a feed from your forward-facing camera, just straight POV. Then number four, maps, which I think are pretty killer. I've talked about it with Google Glass. If you go to navigate somewhere, you can open up the maps and then get turn-by-turn directions and a rotating map that tracks with your head to match the direction you're facing, which to someone like me with a terrible sense of direction is so clutch. And then number five is subtitling basically anything you want in the real world. It uses the beamforming microphones to specifically listen to whatever's in front of you and then put that live text on the HUD of exactly what they're saying. And it works pretty quickly. And if that speech is in another language, it should be able to live translate everything for you to understand what they're saying. Again, so clutch, and this is all being wrapped into a real product that you can buy this year with a real price tag that is $800, which yeah, it's expensive, it's the price of a whole phone, but it's actually a little bit less expensive than I maybe would've guessed before actually hearing that. I wouldn't be surprised if Meta is actually losing money on the hardware here in an effort to just get them out and get 'em into people's hands. But that also conveniently brings us to maybe the biggest downside of this particular product, which is that it is Meta. And that's not a disaster. I mean, obviously people already like the Meta Ray-Bans already, but it also does mean you still will have the privacy questions of exactly what data's being collected and what they do with it. And then the other thing, I dunno if you noticed, but every app that you use on these glasses is strictly first-party stuff. Like messaging with your friends, that's WhatsApp. Video calls on the glasses, that's also WhatsApp. That's not Google Maps, it's their own mapping service, which I can guarantee won't have the best real-time traffic info or ratings like Google Maps has. And they'll even let you scroll through Instagram Reels because Meta owns Instagram. The only exception I saw to this rule was the music playback was done through a partnership with Spotify. But as of right now, or at launch, there is no app store for these. It's coming allegedly, but not yet. But overall, though, I just can't help but be super impressed with how quickly they have been moving forward with this. Like I said, less than a year ago was that crazy prototype with the separate computer and the $10,000 bill of sale. And now here we are, it's just, it's moving so quickly. And I know we're expecting other entries into the smart-glasses space probably within the next couple months, I think from Samsung and from Google and maybe some others. But as of right now, these are the best smart glasses with a screen that I've tried, hands down. And you know, the sad thing is you wouldn't really get that from the presentation at all. The keynote was so brutal, mainly because so many of the live demos that they tried went about as poorly as they possibly could have. I mean, I watched it live. If you get to watch that back, you'll know what I'm talking about. And it's unfortunate because the product is so cool, and I gotta give them props for trying to do real demos instead of faking everything, I guess. But yeah, this isn't gonna be convincing anyone. - What do I do first? - [AI] You've already combined the base ingredients, so now grate a pear to add to the sauce. - What do I do first? - [AI] You've already combined the base ingredients, so now grate the pear and gently combine it with the base sauce. - All right, I think the Wi-Fi might be messed up. - [AI] Pause WhatsApp video call. - There we go. (notification chiming) Uh-oh. Well, let's see what happened there. (notification chiming) That's too bad. I don't know what happened. The irony of the whole thing is that you spend years making technology, and then the Wi-Fi on the day kind of catches you. - So yeah, there's a distinct lack of good videos of people using this tech and these headsets right now. But I'm predicting that when these actually do come out in a few weeks, that we're gonna see a pretty significant wave of all this new content of the cool stuff people get to do with this from the live-captioning to the maps to the AI stuff that it's capable of, all at once. People are just gonna start flooding the internet with content about it. But yeah, seeing how fast these improved really actually for the first time in a while, it got me thinking about if it could bring us closer to a post-smartphone world, which is obviously still super far away. These still need a smartphone to connect to, to work. But you know, imagine a world where you're walking around on a scenic hike and you see a cool scene and instead of taking your phone out and putting a computer between you and the scene, you just, you know, snap the picture on your glasses and just appreciate it. Seems nice, right? Then again, would you rather be talking to someone and see them check their phone or their smartwatch real quick, and it's kind of rude, but then they're over it? Or you're talking to someone who's maybe wearing some glasses like this and every once in a while they just kind of glance down and to the right a little bit while they're talking to you and it's subtle, but you don't know if they're actually paying attention to you or not. Something to think about. Anyway, thanks for watching. Catch you very soon in the next one. Peace.

GB0b6KFZVq0,AirPods Pro 3 Review: I Understand It Now!,,Tech & Business,"(gentle techno music) - Okay, so this is actually the same thing that happened to me with the last generation, where it's September, it's really busy. I didn't really think I was gonna review these. There's lots of other stuff I gotta get to, but just like last time, Apple sent me their latest AirPods Pros. And the first thing I did this time with them was get on a plane and fly with them. And now, I gotta show you these new headphones. These are AirPods Pro 3. They look physically almost the same as AirPods Pro 2, but there's actually a host of new things here. And the thing is I'm not normally an earbuds person and I'm certainly not typically a wear my headphones all day, every day type of person, like so many are. But with all the improvements that they've stacked up in this third generation, I get it. I totally get it. And I think there are a lot of things in here specifically made for that type of person. But first of all, they still sound really good. This was one of the first things I was impressed with with the last gen and I even did some back-to-back listening. And I think these sound even a little bit better. There's more strong base and low end while still keeping, you know, a totally full mid-range and crisp bright highs and very little high volume distortion. And they do seem to get even louder too. And there's a couple reasons behind this sound improvement. If you look very carefully, you'll notice the vents are actually slightly bigger and the interior is redesigned to allow for more airflow. So, I'm betting that's where a bit of that better bass response comes from. But then, also the ear tips go into your ears at a slightly different angle, which you can tell if you look at the second gen right next to this third gen. And the new ear tips are also bolstered with a little bit of foam inside the end. So, they're not fully foam ear tips. They're still silicon, but you kind of get the best of both worlds now. The foam ear tips that you might see on some IMs, you kind of compress them, and then let them expand in your ear. It's this really nice seal and a great fit, but not great for everyday use outside. So, this has some of those benefits in the tip. They have some foam that kind of like molds to the inside of your ear. It's a little bit firmer and it does fit a little better, so it's a better seal. And I gotta say this new combo of the new ear tips, which there's also now a double extra small size by the way. So, there's five ear tip sizes. But the new ear tips plus the new angle that they go into your ear makes these the first air pods that have ever stayed in my ears. It's been years and generations of AirPods that have always slightly wiggled out over time, but these actually stay and that's a game changer for me. Now, I still give the nod to the Powerbeats Pro for working out just because that piece that goes around your ear for the extra bit of security when you're running, or jumping, or moving around a lot, that can't be beat. But for the everyday walking around headphones, these are incredible. They've also added IP57 dust and water resistance for the first time. So they were IPX4 before, which meant they could take a splash, or a sprinkle, or go out in the rain, but now they are protected against a little bit of dust and they can fully survive being submerged underwater. So, that's better for heavy rain, better for spills especially, and even better for a ton of sweat. Like if you somehow sweat so much that AirPods couldn't handle it before, they can now handle it. And turns out this case is also IP57 rated as well which is nice, but that does actually mean it's a new case. And so, the more you look at this new case, the more you'll notice there's a bunch of other little small differences here as well. Like it's a tiny bit thicker and taller, because of the new shape of the buds. And then also, the cutout for the pairing/battery indicator light is now gone, but the light's still there. It's just behind the plastic now and quite a bit brighter, clean. And also just like AirPods 4, the pairing button is gone from the back. So pro tip, if you do need to manually pair these to a non-Apple device for some reason like a computer or an Android phone, you have to open the case and double tap the front to put them in pairing mode. Then there's also a next generation Ultra Wideband chip in the case, which means you can do precision finding from 50% further away, which is extremely convenient. Honestly might still be an underrated feature. The old buds don't fit in the new case and the new buds don't fit in the old case, by the way, just in case you are wondering. And then, there's also some articles about how these don't seem to come with a charging cable and that's true. I unbox them. Sure enough, there was no USB type C cable in that box, but also neither do AirPods 4. And I think you know, to be honest, like most other headphones come with the charging cable, but I think Apple is assuming, probably fairly, that if you're buying the new AirPods, which suck to use with any non-Apple device, then you 99.9% most likely already have an iPhone from the past three years and therefore, already have a USB type C charger or you already have an Apple Watch, which it can also use that charger, or you already have some MagSafe puck somewhere that you can also use. They're probably right, but also the battery life is actually longer on these two, so they'll do eight hours with noise cancellation up from six. So, you can ignore your coworkers for an entire uninterrupted nine to five. And then, transparency mode or hearing aid functionality will do up to 10 hours now from the previous six. Slide in the keynote that rose my eyebrow the most when I saw it when they introduced this a few days ago was ""World's best Active Noise Cancellation,"" of any in-ear wireless headphones. No asterisk, no fine print, no weird comparisons or anything, just all gas, no breaks, big claim. Now, Apple says a lot of things, things like the iPhone 16 Pro has studio quality microphones. Stuff that's obviously not totally true or that's greatly exaggerated for marketing purposes. But this one, this one's interesting. So, the way they're quantifying it is they're saying it cancels twice as much noise as the last gen, which were already really good. Matter of fact, if you go and watch that 2022 keynote, when they introduced the AirPods Pro 2, they said that those were twice as powerful as the first gen AirPods Pro. Now, these do have the same H2 chip as the previous generation, so it's not the chip, but the new ear tips with foam, the new angle that they go into your ears, and the bigger vents and probably some more improved software tuning all combine to give you much better, allegedly two times noise cancellation from the previous. And yeah, the ANC is pretty incredible in these. With my music at basically half volume, I already hear nothing but my music. Now in this studio environment, where you know, there's some voices, maybe occasional louder noises, one really loud mechanical keyboard and a few dog barks, like that's pretty easy. I'm locked in. I'm only hearing my music. But I also took a flight with these, like I said, and the white noise of the airplane just dropped down. It was almost completely erased, not totally to zero, but more than enough to fully immerse in whatever media I want to and actually enjoy the improved audio quality, which is saying something. And these of course still have other features, transparency mode, adaptive EQ, conversational awareness is here I'm just, I'm very happy with this ANC. I went and compared them back to back with the Bose QC Ultra 2, which I found less comfortable and don't seal in my ear as well. And they also don't cancel as much sound. The Sony WF-1000XM5 sound really good, but the fit and noise cancellation also aren't as strong. And these Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are very comfortable and I think even look better, but don't sound as good or cancel as much background noise. These have been pretty excellent for me. Still no lossless audio to anything not called Vision Pro, but this is about as good as I've heard wireless earbuds sound. Now speaking of workout headphones, these also have a new feature and it's this little window over here in the back of them, that's a heart rate monitor. So, AirPods Pro 3 can measure your heart rate while working out. I consider this a nice to have the same way it was in the Powerbeats Pro. What's nice is it's well integrated in the Apple Fitness app. So even if other earbuds integrate heart rate sensors, not sure they'll be able to plug in to this ecosystem as nicely to count your calories and keep your rings closed. Classic. But it's nice for people who don't have Apple Watches. So if you do have an Apple Watch and you wear it at the same time and work out, apparently it's using its own algorithms and software to decide which is the better source to take that data from. Because at no point does the app tell you or let you choose where it's getting your heart rate. Apple also introduced live translation alongside AirPods Pro 3. It's not exclusive to these like they might want you to think. So I won't spend too much time on it in this review, but it is powered by Apple Intelligence and it does require you download each individual language offline before using it. So, everything works offline without internet connection. So, that's cool. And I'm starting to think this is the perfect year to do a big comparison just on all these live translate features 'cause it seems like 2025 is the year of live translation. And there's a bunch of different versions of it and I kind of wanna see which one's best, like is it a phone app, or is it phone plus headphones, or will it be smart glasses with AI, or will it be a pin? That probably won't be a pin. But this really feels like the year live translation actually finally became possible. But overall, okay, better fit, better sound, better ANC, IP rating now, better battery life, all for the same price. I get it. People who wear AirPods all day are gonna love these things. People who sometimes wear AirPods are also gonna love these things. Honestly, the only reason they're not about to become my new dailies is because I still prefer over-ear headphones. So, I mostly still use my Sonys for traveling, and listening to music, and watching movies. Anytime I'm on a plane, I have these. And then when I work out, it's back to dedicated workout headphones, which for me are still the Powerbeats. But if you want one pair of headphones to do everything or if you're on the fence, like these really don't have any weaknesses, if you're an iPhone user. Well played Apple, well played. Now fun fact, the original AirPods were announced 3,295 days ago and they still look like this, Like the tech has gotten way, way better. But all these generations later, they still go with this small white, glossy dental floss case. So, channel sponsor Dbrand can change that. 'Cause the grip case for the AirPods Pro 3 is a great way to keep that charging case safe from scuffs, and scratches, and drops. But I'm really just into how you can change up the look of the things, because you can customize it literally dozens of ways. I've got the matte black one here, but they've got a ton of options to choose from and it goes perfectly with any of Dbrand's phone cases like this Grip case, which can also be customized to match your AirPods or even Dbrand's new Tank Case, this super overkill tactical looking case they've launched alongside the iPhone 17 series. So if you're like me and you wish there was a matte black iPhone 17 Pro this year, well then either of these are pretty good options. So if you are trying to pick up a case for your AirPods or your iPhone 17, then I highly recommend checking out Dbrand Link will be down below. Thanks for watching. Catch you very soon. It's techtember. I'll catch you real soon in the next one. Peace.

idEAABFzpfg,iPhone 17/Pro/Air Impressions: Spot the Red Flags!,,Tech & Business,"(upbeat music) - Hey, what's up, MKBHD here, and welcome to your first look and hands-on of everything Apple has just unveiled today at their 2025 September event. This is iPhone 17, 17 Pro, and 17 Air. Definitely get subscribed to be among the first to see the full reviews when they come out. But this is my first impressions. And I actually found it pretty simple to synthesize my thoughts on everything they announced today. Like there is some good tech, there's some interesting new designs, and some questionable decisions. But the funny thing is, you know, as I go to these events, and as I think about all of this stuff, what usually happens is I end up typically getting some texts from friends asking what I think of the announcements. And my mental task is to summarize everything I'm thinking about into one or two easily-digestible sentences, or just words, to understand what's new and what happened. I don't wanna tell them too much information. And so that's what I'm gonna give you about each of the things Apple announced today. I'm gonna give you my super, super compressed version of what I saw. So let's just start with the iPhone 17, right? The base new iPhones. My ultra-simple summary for the iPhone 17 would be, hey, it got ProMotion and a better selfie camera, and the rest is mostly the same. So the design is mostly unchanged, other than the new colors. Same screen sizes, same dimensions, same camera bump, same buttons, and camera control, which they barely talked about. But there's a new A19 chip inside, which we expected. That should see some nice performance gains and efficiency bumps. Roughly 20% faster CPU, which is nice. And battery life should be a few beats longer. And the display is brighter too, getting up to 3,000 nits. But this is the first time we are seeing a Pro-branded feature on a non-Pro iPhone, because every new iPhone across the range now has ProMotion. And it's the same ProMotion too. It's the adaptive 1 to 120 hertz. Doesn't seem to be handicapped at all. It's funny, we always used to have that ""Oh, regular people don't care about 120 hertz"" argument. But now here it is on the new base iPhones, so hey, sounds great to me. This makes the base iPhones much more usable, and so does the new base storage of 256 gigs. So those are welcome upgrades. But the other new thing was the selfie camera. And it was funny, the keynote was pretty chill, up until the point where they started to talk about this, and it was actually the loudest applause, and it was really tempting to make fun of it. But I actually do think this was really clever, because all these new iPhones have this massively-upgraded selfie camera system. They're calling it Center Stage, but I actually think that kind of does a disservice, because the actual Center Stage on their laptops and stuff is kind of annoying. But what's happening is with these phones, they all have a larger 24-megapixel square selfie camera sensor. And so then when you go to take a selfie, the phone can take a regular vertical selfie, or can manually, or even automatically, take a horizontal selfie without you having to rotate the phone. And honestly, this might be genius. Like the default for most people is obviously to take a vertical selfie now. It just fits on the phone. You're probably viewing it on the phone. But if you go to take a horizontal selfie to fit more people, suddenly the camera lens is off to the side, and it's a little bit less natural-looking. So now since the selfie camera is larger, and a square, it can literally just crop an 18-megapixel selfie in portrait or landscape. And for videos or photos. I think it's great, it's very useful. It might be the biggest upgrade to the iPhone 17. So then there's the iPhone 17 Pro. And my quick, friendly summary of the Pro phones is, hey, they got better zoom, and more battery, and orange. So the Pro iPhones actually look a little bit different. There's actually quite a bit going on here with this new design. First of all, there's only three colors. Cosmic Orange, Deep Blue, and Silver. Really bumming me out that there's no black Pro phone. But then I remembered dbrand exists. Nevermind. But then the thing that's gonna catch everyone's eye on the back is the camera bar up at the top, which is what Apple keeps calling in their keynote a plateau. It kind of looks a little bit like the Pixel's visor, or frankly, what we've been seeing on a ton of other Android phones for years now. Just a huge bar across the top of the back of the phone. But it's actually not just cameras in here. Apple's done some rearranging of the insides of the phone, to actually shove more components, like the A19 Pro chip, and the logic board and storage up here in that bar, so they could fill out more of the bottom of the phone with more battery. And that approach is gonna make even more sense in a little bit. But my first reaction to that is, oh yeah, great, that sounds like these Pro phones might actually come with a real substantial battery upgrade from last year, which is, again, very welcome. Now you might also notice some other little things like the millimeter-wave antenna at the top of the phone, and the ring around that plateau actually also being an antenna. But then the other new design element is that they actually switched back to aluminum. Which is interesting, because we just saw, like, two years ago the iPhone 15 Pro's whole thing was titanium. The new titanium color and titanium rails. And it was a whole big deal. But now they're switching back to aluminum in a unibody form because it's much better thermally. And so there's also a new vapor chamber right in the middle of the back of this phone. First time we've seen a vapor chamber on the iPhone. And so this new cooling system, and new unibody aluminum build, should mean the iPhone shouldn't get nearly as hot from sustained loads to the chip. Which is different from normal, bursty, quick on-and-off workloads of everyday use. I'm talking more about like rendering long videos, or playing an intense game for a long time with ray tracing at high frame rates. This phone should be able to keep cool, and keep that performance high without overheating. Apple is saying 40% better sustained performance. So yeah, this design, it is just a little bit more than meets the eye. You know, rearranging some components here and there, being more efficient, better cooling, and better battery. The number that they quoted on stage was 39 hours of video playback, which, whatever, dumb stat, video playback. It's kind of ridiculous. But okay, we'll take that. And I also looked up the iPhone 16 Pro Max's video playback, and that was also a great battery life phone. That one quoted 33 hours. So maybe up to like 10% battery life on this phone, which is sick. And then there's the cameras that I mentioned. They always go hard with Pro phones and cameras. And this generation is no exception, with the main improvement being the new 48-megapixel 4X telephoto camera. Now 4X might be a lesser number than last year's 5X, but that was a smaller 12-megapixel sensor. This new zoom camera is a 56% larger sensor, and has way more resolution. It's 48 megapixels. So that is a smaller gap between the main camera and the zoom. And you should be able to continue to zoom further, and crop more with less consequence, now that you have 48 megapixels. The Pro phones also get the new selfie camera, they also get the new brighter display. These also got Qi2 support. And then they also got some seriously Pro features that I'm looking forward to testing, like Genlock sync support, and also ProRes RAW video, which I will hopefully be getting to test in an autofocus video coming up very soon. But of course there was one more new iPhone, the iPhone Air. No number, just Air. And you all know what that means? They're doing the ultra-thin thing, and they're leaning in hard. So this thing is a stunningly, ridiculously thin 5.6 millimeters at the thinnest part. And you can tell from the commercials, you can tell from my footage here, and, you know, the first time I hold the phone it has the same effect on me that the S25 Edge did from Samsung, which is just, it's so sick. Like clearly nobody's asking for thinner phones, but once you hold one, it is pretty impressive that they're able to make something like this. But there are also absolutely some red flags that come along with this. So the basics are, it's a 6.5-inch ProMotion display. It's got the A19 Pro chip inside. Titanium body. The new selfie camera of course is in there, and it has a single 48-megapixel Fusion camera on the back with the new design, again. Same camera as the iPhone 17, but with the nice plateau from the Pro phone. And then there's a new N1 chip inside for all the networking connectivity, which is Wi‑Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, Thread, and a new, more energy-efficient C1X modem for cellular. I put out a short that basically already said this, but I really think this phone is gonna be a hard sell, because if you subtract emotions from it, it's the worst one. This is gonna jump in the lineup at 999. It replaces essentially the Plus phones in the lineup. And it is surrounded by other iPhones that are better than it in basically every way, other than being super thin and light. So it's a fascinating gamble. This phone has the same A19 Pro chip in it as the Pro phones, minus one GPU core. Interesting choice. Apparently it's a bit more efficient than the base A19, so that's good for battery life. But we also just heard a whole long list of choices Apple made with the Pro phones to make them more thermally efficient to not overheat. Switching from titanium to aluminum, and adding a vapor chamber to the back. But this phone is still titanium, and absolutely does not have room for an advanced thermal solution, or any sort of vapor chamber. So it sounds like this phone could get much hotter, and throttle performance much quicker. It's a red flag. Now we also know that ultra-thin phones have a tendency to be a little bit less durable. They've bent over the years. And I'm not gonna be the first one to point this out. I mean, you're, I'm sure already glued to JerryRigEverything's channel for his bend test. And Apple of course has thought about this. They've for sure tested this, and they're telling us it's the most durable iPhone ever. But I mean, I'm looking at the phone, and I think it qualifies also as a red flag. And then we already know there is just no way battery life can be good on this phone, right? There's just no way. I've been reviewing phones for more than a decade, and all signs point to it being trash. There was a slide in the keynote today about how they were still proud to achieve all-day battery life. But, like come on. Really? I mean they still do the thing where they rearranged the components up into the little plateau at the top to make room for more battery at the bottom. But there's just absolutely not enough room in this phone for a large battery. And it doesn't appear to be silicon-carbon, or any sort of a special ultra-high density battery. And Apple also announced it alongside a special dedicated MagSafe battery accessory, just for this phone, that adds 3,149 mAh, and just barely, combined, will match the 17 Pro in terms of quoted video playback. So if that doesn't scream red flag, I don't know what to tell you. It is also e-SIM-only, globally, 'cause there's no room in any version of this phone for a plastic SIM card. There's also no millimeter-wave 5G. And like I said, it's coming in at $1,000, which is more expensive than the base iPhone, which will have a better camera system, and better battery life, and may overheat less. So look, I think there's two ways to look at this phone. This is either Apple just throwing something new at the wall and seeing if it sticks. Like we just saw them try, okay, they had the Mini phone for, like, two years, and that really didn't sell that well. So then they moved to the Plus, and that was also a little bit underwhelming. So now they're trying that same spot in the lineup for a ultra-thin phone, and seeing if maybe they can market that to turn into some more sales. So you can see it as that. Or you can see this as a visionary, long-time-in-the-making preview at the future of all phones. Like, maybe someday in the future every phone will be this thin. And Apple is just now, today, getting the tech together with the battery and display and modem and Apple Silicon to make this phone possible. Maybe kind of like how the first MacBook Air sucked, and was underpowered, but then eventually all laptops became that thin. Maybe that's also what's gonna happen to smartphones. And maybe the same way Samsung made the ultra-thin S25 Edge, and then a few months later they came out with their super-thin foldable, the Z Fold7, and I felt like the Edge phone was one half of that foldable. Maybe that's also what Apple's doing. Maybe we're gonna see an ultra-thin foldable iPhone next year. Maybe. Either way, I do think it's clear that you probably won't find too many logical reasons to pick up this first-gen iPhone Air. But I do also think that picking it up and holding it is gonna convince a lot of people, 'cause it's pretty stunning in person. And it's the same thing I said about the Samsung phone. It's pretty sick. But only time will tell for that part of the story. Now, there were a couple other announcements today. There were new AirPods Pro 3, which have twice as good ANC as the last gen, which is crazy. Plus IP57, and heart rate tracking during workouts. All at the same $250 price. Definitely gonna test those. And there's also a new Apple Watch Series 11, now with 5G, and possible hypertension detection. And a slightly new Watch Ultra 3 with thinner bezels, LTPO3, and slightly longer battery life. I'm gonna be testing all this stuff over the next couple weeks, so get subscribed and I'll see you in those videos. And shout out to channel sponsor Ridge for being ahead of the game, because while the iPhone Air does lack battery, it does still have MagSafe, which means you're gonna wanna pick up a Ridge Power Bank. I've seen plenty of power banks over my 15 years of reviewing tech, but this Ridge one quickly became a favorite. It's got five ways to charge, 15-watt MagSafe-compatible wireless charging, two built-in cables, USB-C up to 20 watts, and Lightning for older Apple devices. And a charging pad for your Apple Watch, pass-through charging, so it doubles as a hub, and it also comes in three colors. Matte Black, Matte Olive, and, I guess, perfect for the new iPhone 17 Pro color, Basecamp Orange. Ridge also makes a MagSafe card holder that snaps right onto your iPhone and holds up to three cards. Every Ridge product comes with a lifetime warranty, and a 99-day risk-free trial. So get one today, and head over to ridge.com/mkbhd for 10% off. Thanks for watching. See you guys very soon in the next videos. Peace.

i63u-iAnhuk,Pixel 10/Pro Review: Good News and Bad News!,,Tech & Business,"(relaxing dance music) - All right, I have good news and bad news. What do you want first? The good news, great. Good call. It's still a Pixel. The bad news? It is still a Pixel. (lively dance music) See, the Pixel 10 has had some high hopes and some hype behind it for the past couple months. You know, it's the 10th generation. It could be special. The first one with a TSMC chip could be special. Some other things could be revamped alongside Android 16. Like, it was looking really promising to potentially reboot the whole Pixel thing, to finally have it really competing with flagships. Now instead, it is very much all the things we liked and all the things we disliked about the Pixel already, but the competing with flagships part is coming in the form of a mainstream marketing push. A Jimmy Fallon presentation, a Jonas Brothers music video. I can't say I would've spent the money the exact same way if I was in charge of the Pixel program, but hey, that's why I'm the reviewer and they're the Google executives. So, unlike the event, let's just focus on the phones. So, this thing is very similar to last year in design, in materials, and in character. Like the camera visor, the glossy glass back with the satin aluminum sides, and vice versa on the Pro phones. Even as an enthusiast about this stuff, you could probably show me a Pixel 9, and unless I knew exactly which one was the new gray color, it could be easily mistaken for the new one. And to me, honestly, that's fine. I love this design. The camera bar is nice for holding the phone. It gathers some dust, sure, but you'll probably also have a case on your phone. Great, click-y buttons, great haptics. All of these things are still true about the Pixel. The bad news though, is that the things that the Pixels of the past have been lacking, this one is still lacking. Pixels have never had the biggest numbers or the most bleeding-edge hardware. And these Pixel 10s are still Pixels, so they don't have super fast charging. They don't have a brand new massive silicon carbon battery. They don't have huge new camera sensors or record-breaking displays. My personal biggest annoyance with the Pixel 9 was the optical under screen fingerprint reader was kinda slow. This Pixel 10 actually does have an ultrasonic fingerprint reader now, and it's faster than Pixel 9, but just a slight beat behind the other ultrasonic flagships now. But that counts as technically new. So, hey, while we're at it, here's everything that's technically new with the Pixel 10s and my take on them. The main new thing is we get a full triple cameras on the base phone, and I'll get more into the quality of those cameras in a minute, so that is a nice inclusion. After that, it's a bunch of subtle things that sort of combine to make it feel a little more flagship-y but without actually leapfrogging into ultra phone territory. So, the fingerprint reader, like I said, is ultrasonic now and slightly faster. And the display that it's built into is a bit brighter too, so it looks better outdoors. The bezels didn't get thinner, but there's little grills now over the slightly better speakers at the bottom of the phone that are color matched to the metal now. Cool. And the physical SIM card tray is now completely gone. This phone in the US is eSIM only, which I don't like. eSIM support, great. Forcing me to use eSIM? Not my favorite thing. Only the carriers win with this. And to be fair, maybe I'm over-indexing this just a little bit because I test a lot of phones. I move my physical SIM card really quickly between lots of phones. It takes, like, 10 seconds to switch and test something out real quick. So, I don't like this at all, but yeah, eSIM only. The batteries are about 200 milliamp hours larger in these phones across the lineup. That's a nice win. But the internals that are gonna make a real difference that people are actually gonna care about are Tensor and Pixel Snap. So, all right, we gotta talk about this new Tensor chip. Google phones, for years, have used off-the-shelf chips from Qualcomm, which made sense, they were great. And then the Pixel 6 was the first one to use their in-house design Tensor chip instead. And the promise of Tensor was never really clear, but the idea was to give Google much more control over these chips and for optimizing for exactly what they wanna get out of a Pixel. The thing is, the first Tensor chip wasn't that good. Actually, it was so weak that it had people considering if they should have even left Qualcomm in the first place. But, you know, we gotta let 'em cook for a little bit, right? Let them develop this idea. And so, a couple generations in, all of these first few Tensor chips were sort of co-designed with Google and Samsung, and it was heavily based off of an Exynos chip and actually still fabricated by Samsung. So, fast forward to today, the Pixel 10 is powered by a Tensor G5 chip, the first version of a totally Google-designed Tensor chip on a three-nanometer process and manufactured straight by TSMC, which seems like the perfect opportunity to make a huge leap in power, in efficiency, in achieving the original mission of doing their own Tensor chip, and it turns out it's good. It's a really good chip, but it's not magic. The main complaint that I and other Redditors would have about Tensor chips of the past was that they were simply not flagship level power of CPU and GPU. And this is $1,000 phone. Like, for this price, I could just get a Galaxy S25+ and have a Snapdragon 8 Elite, or an iPhone 16 with an A18. So, this new Tensor G5 is more performant than before, but it's not miraculously jumping all the way to the level of the Snapdragon 8 Elites of the world. And I'm starting to think that's not even really one of its goals. Tensor G5 benchmarks like a mid-range phone, like the CPU is about 30% better than last generation, but is a solid amount still behind the Snapdragon chips in Samsung phones. And it's closer to, like, the 8S Gen 4, the one in the Nothing Phone 3. And the GPU. The GPU gap, if my benchmarks are correct, are even bigger. For some reason, Geekbench 6 OpenCL scores are literally half of the Pixel 9s and a full, like, 600% behind the Snapdragon 8 Elite. Jesus. Its strongest area though, is definitely the TPU, where this one is 60% more powerful than last generation, and that is intentional. This is the Tensor processing unit that's specifically designed to accelerate machine learning and AI-related tasks like running on device models, editing photos, et cetera. This is what Google has decided is most important to them with these phones and these chips. They want them to be the fastest and most capable AI devices. So, in the real world, performance wise, this Pixel 10, it is a really smooth phone with everyday tasks. I've been flying around Android 16, multitasking, flying through apps, high refresh rate is always on. Not even really thinking about it too much. It's been very fluid. I will say though, when I went in after a few days into display settings and flipped from High resolution to Max resolution, things sharpened up a bit, but the phone also did get slightly, just barely noticeably, slower. Just a few dropped frames here and there, which I didn't expect. And I would also not be shocked at all if you did head-to-head comparisons with graphically intense games, and frame rate measurements of the Pixel 10 fall far behind the higher, more powerful GPU chips. It also lacks hardware-accelerated ray tracing. That's just not the big strength of this phone. Never has been. And it's still a Pixel, so I'm not expecting it ever will be. What I can say is, at least the battery life for my use has been solid. It's been solid. I've been mostly testing the Pixel 10 Pro, not the XL, so even on a regular-sized phone, I'm getting all-day battery near dead by the end of the day, but, like, six hours of screen-on time and high brightness and all that. So, it's been decently efficient. My main concern is now shifting to how well this phone will age, so maybe trying to come back to this in six months, one year, two years, just to see how well this does compared to previous Pixels. But for now, the Tensor chip, it's not some miraculous savior that makes it an ultra flagship, but good chip. Good chip. You know what's really good, though? Pixel Snap. It sounds silly, but this has genuinely become one of my favorite new features about the Pixel 10s. It's just such a quality of life improvement, especially as someone who is a card-carrying member of Team No Case. So, these phones have Qi2 wireless charging now, and it's only at 15 watts, or 25 on the XL, but it's so incredibly convenient to just be able to slap the Pixel onto any of my existing MagSafe accessories, navigating with the phone in the dash in the morning, dropping the phone on a wireless charger on my desk where they automatically align, keeping it topped up on a long travel trip with my Ridge power bank. Even if you aren't someone with a bunch of existing MagSafe stuff sitting around, it just opens you up to this massive world of options for magnetic accessories for things you can attach to your phone, or things you can attach your phone too. And I even think this is actually slightly stronger than MagSafe magnets on the iPhone, at least with the first-party Google accessories they've optimized, like with this Pixel ring stand I got to try. Honestly, this was the perfect addition to this phone. It's like it was already a phone that didn't have very fast wireless charging, and so it still doesn't have very fast wireless charging, but it just gained a ton of functionality. Thumbs up. The two things that always make a Pixel a Pixel though, well, that would be the cameras and the software. So, I have good news and bad news again. Which do you want first? The good news. Classic. Yeah, the software is still awesome. These phones all ship with Android 16 out the box, all of the fun material, 3 Expressive updates, the fun smart wallpaper cutout effects, the animations, the haptics, the notification jiggle physics, all this stuff. There's some weird stuff that's not all perfect, like I don't love how massive some of the buttons are getting. Like, okay, maybe the Alarm app one makes sense. Fine, make those bigger. But the Weather app, like this list of locations has such massive gaps now. So much dead white space between them. Or the Phone app now, too. They're making these buttons huge. This new Gmail app, these archive buttons are absolutely massive. And look at this stopwatch. Jesus. But, you know, for the most part, I'm loving how colorful and clean and fluid everything has been. And there's so many little things you can tweak and poke around and have fun with. Trust me, just watch a few YouTube tutorials on how to set up the perfect quick settings or have the ultimate all-widgets home screen set up. It's awesome, super flexible. You're welcome. And then there's all the AI stuff on top as well because, you know, Google. And there's a lot of this stuff that sort of just pops up as you start using this phone, and you can choose to engage with it or just kind of ignore it if you're not into it. But any one of these features could turn out to be that awesome thing that makes you wanna stick with the Pixel, like Call Screening or Now Playing. And so, the big new one on the Pixel 10s that's got its own section in the settings and everything is called Magic Cue. And this Magic Cue, it's a very Google thing that's supposed to take data from across your different apps and services and then surface them where you need them. At least that's what it's supposed to do. Now, I was using this phone and trying to get it to work. Like I was lobbing up perfect situations for it to kick in and read my Gmail or read my calendar, and then give me the perfect text to send back, but it rarely seemed to work exactly the way I wanted it to like it did in my original demos. The thing it did the most often was it just kept giving me a link back to, like, open my calendar and check for the information myself, which is still kinda helpful, but only half as helpful as advertised. I have all the settings turned on, so it's supposed to be able to look into any of these apps, screenshots, email, Messages, also Keep and Contacts and Calendar to return the answer to the question pulled from inside the app. A few times, I did actually get that to work for me, but sometimes it was wrong. Like I have Andrew asking me for my flight info next week, but it's giving me the info to the flight I have this week, and that would be fine if I could go edit it before I send it, but if I click it it, just sends the whole thing automatically, and doesn't also include some of the information I would think you want, like the flight number. I can see the promise here. It feels like it's still a work in progress. The other thing, though, that I found pretty interesting was conversational editing. It actually is coming to all phones with Google Photos, so it's not just, like, a specific Pixel thing, so I won't spend too much time on it, but it's potentially a game changer because it's semantic photo editing from text prompts, so it understands what you're asking for and then does the editing for you, from simple stuff like, you know, brighten up the faces or remove the road sign, or even just make this picture better, which usually does, like, a nice crop and centers it around the subject and evens out the exposure. But all the way up to complicated stuff too, like, ""Add a hot air balloon to the sky."" It'll do that. Or, ""Delete the cars and make the sky bluer."" And then it does it. It just does a surprisingly good job just from hearing what you said. Google, genuine question, is video editing next? Is that even possible? Should I be concerned? Excited? I don't know, we'll see. There was a couple other things like the Journal app and NotebookLM, which are both pre-installed on these phones. Also, daily briefs was next to useless for me. Like it's supposed to be tailored to me and relevant to my day, but yeah, that's not really a ton of useful information here. But overall, like I said, the software is really good. And if there's anything that pops up that you don't like, you can literally just ignore it. So, that is the good news. So then the bad news, the cameras. And this is where it kinda gets a little bit weird. It's not like they're bad cameras, but the bad news is that it does feel like the cameras are slipping a little bit. The Pixel has leaned heavily on elite software processing for years. They, surprise, never really had the biggest sensors or the best hardware, but they pioneered HDR+, and the Pixel camera always had this sort of confident, contrasty look to it. This generation of phones, it still has that look, but objectively speaking, like these cameras, they just don't stand out from the pack nearly as much anymore. And in some ways, they're kind of falling behind a bit now. Triple cameras, like I said, are awesome to have on the base phone. So, that 48 megapixel main camera, the ultrawide, and the telephoto is a 5x. And then the Pros have a bigger 50 megapixel main camera, a bigger, higher resolution ultrawide, and a bigger, higher resolution 5x telephoto as well. So, regular wide shots from the Pixel 10 and 10 Pro, they look great. You know, sure, the sensor's a little smaller on the base phone, but they both do a great job with sharpness and dynamic range and lots of detail, and usually pretty great color too. They have that look. Night Sight is still elite. But past that, it's just not good at any type of zoom like I was hoping it would be. The ultrawide is okay, but usually pretty soft around the edges with a bit more chromatic aberration that I'm used to seeing. And then trying to zoom in was, like, just surprisingly bad, at least compared to other flagships with decent zoom. Almost every photo I've taken, even on these Pros that's zoomed in, is just soft. Like, colors would be fine and it's bright enough, and it's not a terrible image. Mission still accomplished, I guess. But, like, this super res zoom feature on the Pros that kicks in for everything past 30x really feels like it encourages me to take a bunch of Zoom photos because once I do, it'll run it through the processing and sharpen things up and resolve detail out of thin air with a little machine learning. But yeah, the results just weren't that great. I didn't even go all the way to a 100x. All the pictures I'm taking are, like, 30 to 50x. And they kinda look like they have a cartoon filter over them, even compared to a pretty mediocre zoom like the iPhone 16 Pro. And it gets absolutely smoked by a good zoom like the S25 Ultra, even though that's more expensive. Maybe I shouldn't be complaining about 50x zoom photos, maybe nobody cares, but the sweet spot for zoom is definitely like 5 to 10x, or a little past that maybe. And then the wide photos are still obviously really good. It's just the gaps in zoom performance are a little weird, considering how much it seems to encourage me to take zoom photos. And then there's video performance, which is still also beat behind the flagships. If you wanna see samples, I'm planning on shooting the next auto-focus video on the Lucid Gravity on this phone. So, if you care about either Pixel 10 Pro video or the newest, very impressive Lucid SUV, get subscribed over there. I'll drop a link below the like button. But yeah, it'll be all the A-roll shots, and then the B roll will still be from the iPhone so you can compare the two. So, the Pixel 10. It's still a Pixel, it feels like the Pixel is a finished slash complete thought for now, just based on the way Google's acting and working around this phone. And they're not making any big philosophical changes to the way they attack making a Google phone. They're just trying again to take it to the masses. So, if you didn't like the Pixel last year for certain reasons, like, you know, ""Oh, it's not the best hardware or it's not the most powerful,"" then you still won't like the Pixel. But if you love the Pixel of previous years 'cause, oh, it's this cool design that you like or it's got great stills or awesome software, then you'll love this Pixel too. Google's path of trying to bring the Pixel to the masses is definitely challenging. Maybe they really believe in Jimmy Fallon and the other celebrity endorsements that will be their savior and finally make it happen. Me personally, I think the other half of their strategy of, like, directly addressing the masses that are on iPhones here and giving 'em reasons to switch with, like, Pixel Snap and other directly competitive parallel features, I think that is far more interesting. And I did just make an entire video about this, so I'll link this below if you haven't seen that yet. But the Pixel still being a Pixel to me is mostly good news. I really like the Pixel. I'm probably gonna switch to this Moonstone Pixel 10 Pro as my main daily driver phone and then I'm probably gonna switch off of it to something with more tempting, interesting hardware features. And then I'll probably switch back when I get bored with the other weird software experiences and I want this feeling again. And then I'll probably switch off of it again when it starts aging poorly. I don't really know. The Pixel is right where it's always been. But you know it's not where it's always been? New products from channel sponsor Ridge, like the new magnetic power bank that works with Pixel Snap. See, Ridge has been in the everyday carry scene for years. But when I joined the team, we wanted to add a little more tech to their lineup, so they created the Ridge Magnetic Power Bank. It's a 10,000 milliamp hour portable battery bank that has five different ways to charge your tech. With Pixel Snap, you can seamlessly connect it to your back of your phone and charge wirelessly. Or if you want, you can use the built-in wires for 20-watt wired charging to top up a little faster. And it even has a nice kickstand so you'll be able to tackle any long plane ride without having to sweat your battery life. And you might be wondering, ""Why do I need a Lightning cable if I'm a Pixel user?"" And let's be real, you probably have some i friends, they're probably all caught up in their blue bubble world, forgot to pack their chargers. So, if you're feeling nice, you can help them top up too. And my favorite part is you can charge multiple devices at the same time with pass through, so this ends up being a nice little one-stop shop for travel charging. It comes in three sweet colors, Basecamp Orange and also Matte Olive and the obvious choice, Matte Black. And if you don't love it within 99 days, send it back, no questions asked. So, hit over to ridge.com/mkbhd to get 10% off your orders. And remember, every dollar you spend until September 15th is more entries in the Ridge Summer Sweepstakes. Thanks for watching. Catch you guys in the next one. Peace.

269OsrzG3Ew,Google Pixel 10/Pro/Fold Impressions: Magnets!,,Tech & Business,"(groovy upbeat music) (logo springing) - All right, they're finally here, the new big 10th-generation Google Pixel phones, and I've got your first hands-on impressions of all of them. First off the plane, by the way. I'm recording this after, like, 20 hours or so of travel back from Chengdu, China, where we just won gold with Team USA in Ultimate Frisbee at the World Games. The games were incredible. The team was incredible. And so, if for the next couple of months I use this massive gold medal shaped like a panda as a prop, sorry in advance, I can't help it. So there were big hopes and expectations for this whole series of phones: Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold. They've been showing us the design on social media for weeks now, but it's what's inside that has the potential to be a game-changer. I will say, though, I actually do like the Pixel 10s' designs. At this point, the camera bar is pretty iconic, so they're keeping that. But then this build is even more flagship-y and high-quality than ever before. It's still IP68-rated, but now it's Gorilla Glass Victus 2, and it's in these four colors: Obsidian, Frost, Indigo, and Lemongrass. It has a nicely upgraded top speaker. It has a brighter 3,000-nit display. They've matched, actually, the speaker grills with the metal color. But then the two biggest things, which both technically count as inside the phone: triple cameras and Pixelsnap. So, triple cameras. I wasn't actually sure if they were gonna do this because we saw the leaks, and I wasn't sure if it was the Pro or not. But it turns out they are finally doing triple cameras in the base Pixel. So we have here a 48-megapixel primary camera, a 13-megapixel ultra-wide, and a 10-megapixel 5x telephoto camera. So that's great, and we'll get to the Pro cameras in a minute. But these phones all also have what's called Pixelsnap, which is basically Google's branding word for finally including Qi2 wireless charging with magnets built into the phone. Wow! I actually didn't see that coming, but I'm very excited about it. This is one of literally two phones now that I've ever held in my hands that has the full Qi2 built into the phone, the other one being literally the HMD Skyline that very few people have ever heard of. But I'm so happy to see it here because it means you can wirelessly charge the phone at 15 watts. And there's also now this whole new ecosystem of magnetic accessories that can slap onto the back of the phone, wireless chargers and stands of course, but even non-chargers like this Pixel Ring stand they're making. And it is, like, firm to the back of the phone, which is awesome. And yes, iPhone MagSafe accessories do line up with these Qi2 magnets. So basically, any accessory out there that will lock onto the back of an iPhone will also lock onto the back of this phone too. So Google is, of course, gonna be selling this $40 Pixelsnap charger. It's just a metal puck; you already know how that works. And the Pixelsnap Ring is $30, and it is actually pretty sturdy for holding up the phone at a bunch of different angles or being a PopSocket. So, for all intents and purposes, Pixelsnap is basically MagSafe. It's great. We'll take it. So you might be thinking, ""Marques, if the base Pixel is so good and it's got the triple cameras now and it's got Pixelsnap and all these upgrades, then what's new with the Pros? Like, is there anything better about the Pros?"" And this has been a theme with the Pixel, which is that there isn't that big of a difference between the base Pixel and the Pro Pixel to justify the price. And that's kind of true again here. So let's play spot the differences. So both these phones are the same size: 6.3 inches on the base, 6.3 inches on the Pro. But the Pro's display is slightly higher resolution and slightly brighter, and it's LTPO with a full 1-to-120Hz variable refresh rate instead of 60-to-120 on the base. You also get more RAM and max storage, and it actually has a slightly smaller battery, likely to make room for the slightly larger triple cameras. So, same focal lengths, but now this time: 50-megapixel main camera, 48-megapixel ultra-wide, and a 48-megapixel 5x telephoto. So with the extra resolution on that telephoto on the Pro, you can zoom in further, all the way into 100x, it'll let you do now. And Pro Res Zoom will do its best to use AI and try to process and sharpen what it thinks you're taking a picture of, where you can only go into 20x with non-Pros. And the Pros come in Moonstone, Jade, and Porcelain. Now, how much better are the Pro's triple cameras gonna be than the base phone's triple cameras? We'll see, you know? And also, does the extra RAM make a big difference? Is the better selfie camera gonna make a big difference? These are things that I have to test in my full review. So definitely get subscribed to be among the first to see that when that drops. But at this point, doesn't seem like there's a massive difference between the base Pixel 10 and the Pixel 10 Pro. Now the 10 Pro XL is a little bit more interesting because then you're also getting a bigger display, of course. Also, a bigger battery, 5,200 milliamp-hours, double the starting storage as well. And it actually charges a bit faster as well, a little more thermal room, so up to 45 watts instead of 30. And they gave it Qi2.2, so it will wirelessly charge at 25 watts instead of 15. But that's basically it. So the Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, and Pixel 10 Pro XL, and they are the same prices, all three of them, as last year. So 799, 999, and 1,199. And then there's the foldy one. So we have the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, which is exciting because we get to see now what are some of the lessons that Google has learned along the way. They've made a first-generation foldable. Okay, so now what are they going to improve? What are they gonna settle in on as the real key things that they keep and the things that they change and evolve? And this one is again for sure more flagship-y than last year, but not in a way that's gonna blow anyone out of the water, just a definite solid all-around improvement. The most important piece, which is the hinge, got the most work. It's this new gearless hinge, and because it's much smaller, it makes that left-side bezel much more trim, leaving the outside screen feeling much more just like a regular, normal phone instead of being slightly offset like last year. So now it's a great phone to use closed. It's a slightly bigger 6.4-inch outer display, the same 20-by-9 aspect ratio. It's a 60-to-120Hz refresh rate, and it's up to 3,000 nits peak brightness again. So this for sure feels like a great closed foldable. And it's now IP68 dust- and water-resistant, which I believe is the first time we've ever seen a foldable be fully dust- and water-resistant. So shoutout to the hinge engineers, the hinge-gineers, for pulling through on that one. So then I unfold it, and it's again a large squareish eight-inch interior display. Nothing too dramatically different here. There's still a somewhat noticeable crease; it's not terrible through the middle, but it's there. The battery is a little bit bigger now: 5,000 milliamp-hours. That's nice to see. And yes, it also still has Pixelsnap, so Qi2 15-watt wireless charging with the magnet array. Love that. Tensor G5. 16 gigs of RAM. Up to a terabyte of storage. And roughly the same triple cameras as last year. It's a 48-megapixel primary sensor; that one's new, but then the same 10-megapixel 5x telephoto and 10-megapixel ultra-wide with macro. It's all in a package that's just slightly thicker than last year's. And the price is also the same: 1,799. And it comes in some nice, boring Jade and Moonstone colors. So it's interesting. I like it. But I do also have to admit it doesn't really do anything that other foldables don't. Like, it's not offering some massive, dramatic improvement. The hardware is not incredibly thin or some crazy lack of a crease or anything like that. It doesn't have super-fast charging. It doesn't have incredible cameras. It doesn't really do anything super special. I mean, IP68 is pretty new, and Pixelsnap is nice. But really, it's a Pixel. And that's the thing that matters. Like, the slightly more flagship-y hardware is one thing that Google's been slowly getting better at over the years. But massive numbers on paper has never been their thing. They've never had a 100-megapixel camera or 100-watt charging. But instead, the Pixel continues the tradition of being the ""smartest"" phone in the room by just having a ton of really useful software features. And they've added some stuff this year that strikes me as stuff that only Google could pull off, because it's using just so much Google stuff. Like, the two that really stuck out to me are Magic Cues and Conversational Editing. So Magic Cues very cleverly basically takes cues from across different services in your Google account to surface information where you might need it. So example, you're texting someone, and they ask you where the dinner reservation in New York is. When Google Messages detects that, it surfaces this little rainbow cue with the answer to the question pulled from Gmail, since you got an email with the information in it to answer that question when you booked. So you can just tap it and have it send the answer in Google Messages. Very convenient. Or say your friend asks you to call United to change your flight 'cause they can't do it themselves for some reason. Okay, well, it knows United's phone number. So it surfaces that for you. And then when you call, it shows this nice Magic Cue with your flight information that you're going to change, the confirmation number, and everything, so you can talk about it. That is incredibly convenient. This is the type of thing Google can pull off because they know so much about you. They know all of your emails; they know when all of your flights and dinner reservations and calendar events and everything all are. This isn't new; this is just them surfacing it in little convenient ways to be useful to you. But then the other thing, conversational editing, this was pretty crazy. I knew we were gonna get here eventually. I just didn't know when or who would get there first. But the idea is, you don't really have to know how to use the photo editing tools on your phone. You can just talk to your phone and tell it what to do. So like, let's say you have this nice picture of your parents, and oh, man, it would just be the perfect picture if he wasn't holding that plastic bag, right? So okay, type into that box at the bottom, or just say, or literally ask to delete the plastic bag. Then give it a few seconds, since it's going to the cloud and back with this AI-based command, but sooner or later, it pops up your new photo with the plastic bag deleted. And it's kind of insane that that actually works. I mean, it seems to understand what I'm asking for. It knows what the plastic bag is. It knows what ""delete"" means. It goes in. It uses generative fill. It does all that. How many of you guys are like family tech support, and somebody needs to Photoshop something, and they just send it to you and ask you to do it? Now that family member might just be able to talk to their phone and have it do it themselves. I mean, they can even get carried away. I tried asking for some more random edits, like turning a cloudy sky blue, and it did a surprisingly good job of it. I also asked for it to add things to the photo; it seemed to also have no problem doing that. The limitations basically seemed to be the same as what Magic Editor has been. So it doesn't really like to mess with faces. But other than that, it's kind of just free game. And this is coming to Google Photos in general. This isn't just a Pixel 10 feature; this is coming to anyone who has Google Photos on their phone. So that's pretty sick. That's very Google. Now there's some other neat stuff on the Pixel 10s, like the Pixel Journal app and live voice translate on phone calls that sounds remarkably similar to my actual voice, but it's AI-generated speaking a different language. All this stuff could potentially be that one killer feature that makes people fall for and stick with a Pixel this year, just like call screening had been in the past. And that's the Pixel story. It's not the brutal, super-high-horsepower raw numbers; it's just clever software. The smartest phone in the room again. And so, you can probably see where this is going, but let's just talk about Tensor for a second. Tensor G5, it's the newest processor in all of these phones. It's a three-nanometer chip. And I don't think it's going to make some magical leap to being Snapdragon 8 Elite levels of performance with this one-generation bump. I mean, I didn't get to run benchmarks, and so I will for my full review, so you can see exactly how much better it is. And I get the sense that they do want it to have better CPU and GPU performance to last year. But in theme with the rest of the phone, it's not the main focus. They will be focusing on TPU, AI stuff, on-device models, and things like the image signal processor. Now, is that a little bit disappointing? To me, a nerd, yeah, a little bit. But at the same time, these phones, as I'm using them in my first impressions, they feel pretty smooth and snappy. I do have to wonder how they'll age. But you know, bumping around the Pixel 10s with Material 3 Expressive and Android 16 and multitasking a little bit and just moving through all kinds of random open apps, it was working quite well. So we shall see. Oh, and by the way, Google also today is unveiling a new Pixel Watch 4, which has an even brighter, larger, and much more domed display that looks really cool. Plus, it charges much faster on this new charging dock and has a 25% longer battery life. So that is very interesting. Plus some new Pixel Buds 2A with active noise cancellation. So let me know in the comments what you guys are interested in seeing for the full reviews. But definitely stay tuned for those videos, 'cause they're coming up as soon as I get my hands on these phones. Should be very interesting. Thanks for watching. All right, a bit of a unique sponsor segment here. As you can see in front of me, I now have 10 Pixels, and I also have 10 of channel sponsor dbrand's Prism 2.0 screen protectors. And I'm not usually a huge screen protector guy, but I've been using these for a little bit, and I like them, so I know how to install them. And the deal is, if I can install 10 of these in a minute, then you guys are gonna get a pretty crazy deal. So, Andrew, I'm gonna need a timer, and just let me know when to start. I'll do a countdown. All right, ready? Three, two, one, go. (plastic rustling) Okay, so 10 phones in a minute is about six seconds per phone. I just gotta keep at a good pace here, and I should be no problem. (plastic rustling) Obviously, these are very easy to install, so it would be pretty embarrassing if I didn't get them all in a minute. (plastic rustling) Perfectly with no bubbles. (plastic installers rattling) Done! (claps) Easy! Well, that was pretty sick. I think that unlocks a little code tree down below, and now I have 10 perfectly skinned Pixels. All right, so the deal is dbrand is gonna give you 42% off a Prism when you bundle it in with one of their Ghost cases, which is also available and shipping now for the Pixel 10 series. So just add any Prism and Ghost to your cart at the link below, use code MKBHD at checkout, and get 42% off the Prism.
