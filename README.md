# yt_emotion_dashboard

## Main Branch Status: Production

This `main` branch contains the **production-ready version** of the YouTube Emotion Dashboard. The code here is configured to run and interact with our **cloud instances**.

### Key Components:
* **Extension Folder:** This folder contains the browser extension that is in **active synchronization** with our cloud setup.
* **main.py:** The core Python script that handles data processing and is essential for the dashboard's functionality.

---

**For the Team:**

* This branch should always reflect the stable, working version of the application.
* **Do not push experimental code directly to `main`**. All new features or developments should be worked on in separate feature branches (e.g., `feature/llm-experimentation`)
* Download and use the Tool from the **Extension folder** and feel free to provide **feedback** there.

**Note:** This README is intended to provide clarity on the purpose and configuration of the `main` branch for all collaborators.
